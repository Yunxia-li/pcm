# Acknowledgements

Thanks to my lab for inspiring me, my family for being my people, and to the students for always keeping us on our toes.

Helpful comments on this book came from many sources, including Arne Mooers, Brian O'Meara, Mike Whitlock, Matt Pennell, Rosana Zenil-Ferguson, Bob Thacker, Chelsea Specht, Bob Week, Dave Tank, and dozens of others. Thanks to all.

If you like my publishing model try it yourself. The book barons are rich enough, anyway.
