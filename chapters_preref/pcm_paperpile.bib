@ARTICLE{Felsenstein1985-bt,
  title     = "Phylogenies and the Comparative Method",
  author    = "Felsenstein, Joseph",
  abstract  = "Comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes,
               or between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently
               carried out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression,
               correlation, and contingency table methods, including
               nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn
               independently from a common distribution. When species are taken
               from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent.
               Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause
               overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some
               illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and
               limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the
               nonindependence have been discussed. A method of correcting for
               the phylogeny has been proposed. It requires that we know both
               the tree topology and the branch lengths, and that we be willing
               to allow the characters to be modeled by Brownian motion on a
               linear scale. Given these conditions, the phylogeny specifies a
               set of contrasts among species, contrasts that are statistically
               independent and can be used in regression or correlation
               studies. The considerable barriers to making practical use of
               this technique have been discussed.",

  abstract  = "Equilibrium models in population biology have demonstrated that
               accurate predictions of species diversity can be made without
               reference to particular taxa. We have extended the use of
               equilibrium models to examine patterns of phyletic
               diversification in the fossil record. We assume that (1) regions
               become saturated with respect to the number of taxa that can
               coexist; and (2) after that limit is reached, rates of
               speciation and extinction are very similar. Using these minimal
               constraints, and the standard precepts of evolutionary taxonomy
               (monophyly), we have generated evolutionary trees by stochastic
               simulation and classified their lineages into clades. Random
               processes with minimal constraints yield phyletic trees similar
               to those based upon the fossil record. Of particular interest
               are the patterns of clade origination and extinction and of
               intraclade diversity. For comparison with computer simulations,
               we present actual clades for the Reptilia. The similarities are
               striking, but some patterns of the fossil record are not
               simulated by random processes. For example, the late Cretaceous
               extinction may represent a fundamentally different type of
               evolutionary event. The simulation program and its comparison
               with the real world permits a clearer separation of stochastic
               and deterministic elements in the evolutionary record.",

@ARTICLE{Lynch1990-fv,
  title     = "The Rate of Morphological Evolution in Mammals from the
               Standpoint of the Neutral Expectation",
  author    = "Lynch, Michael",
  abstract  = "A comparison of the evolutionary rates of cranial morphology in
               mammals with the neutral expectation suggests that stabilizing
               selection is a predominant evolutionary force keeping the
               long-term diversification of lineages well below its potential.
               The rate of morphological divergence of almost all lineages,
               including the great apes, is substantially below the minimum
               neutral expectation. The divergence of the modern races of man
               is slightly above the minimum neutral rate but well below the
               maximum rate. Therefore, there is no need to invoke
               extraordinary mutational mechanisms, such as regulatory gene
               evolution, to explain what has been perceived as rapid
               morphological evolution in mammals. Nor does it appear that
               behavioral drive needs to be invoked to explain rapid
               morphological evolution in hominoids. Outside of man, the
               long-term rate of phenotypic evolution in the great apes is
               actually lower than that for other mammals. The data suggest
               that, immediately after reproductive isolation, most lineages
               diverge morphologically at approximately the neutral rate and
               that this rate declines over evolutionary time. Such a pattern
               is consistent with a broad class of phenotypic evolutionary
               models that invoke an interaction between the forces of random
               genetic drift, polygenic mutation, and stabilizing selection.
               This pattern also suggests that the apparently rapid rates of
               morphological evolution in modern man relative to other mammals
               and in mammals relative to other vertebrates are artifacts of
               temporal scaling.",

@ARTICLE{Lande1976-ol,
  title     = "Natural Selection and Random Genetic Drift in Phenotypic
               Evolution",
  author    = "Lande, Russell",
  abstract  = "The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which
               will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events
               than the classical models of population genetics. This is
               accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic
               parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful
               in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems
               that in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations
               this can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of
               adaptive zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive
               topography for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive
               topography for gene frequencies. This shows that for most
               phenotypic characters under natural selection, the evolution of
               the average phenotype in a population is always toward an
               adaptive zone of high mean fitness (WÌ„) in the phenotype space.
               Frequency-dependent selection may cause the average phenotype to
               evolve away from its adaptive zone, decreasing the mean fitness
               of individuals in the population; different types of
               frequency-dependent selection are classified as to whether or
               not they lead to such maladaptive evolution. A simple formula
               for estimating the minimum selective mortality per generation
               necessary to explain observed rates of phenotypic evolution is
               derived (assuming that genetic drift was not involved). The
               minimum mortality rates needed to explain observed rates of
               evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary mammals are very
               small, typically about one selective death per million
               individuals per generation. This leads to consideration of the
               hypothesis that these changes were caused by random genetic
               drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the observed
               evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have
               occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations,
               with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such
               statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the
               adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain.
               Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a
               selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have
               been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that
               if stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is
               not very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones
               may be an important mechanism of evolution in populations of
               effective size in the hundreds or thousands. These results
               support the contention that random genetic drift may play a
               significant role in phenotypic evolution.",

                 nature, in some cases associated with changes in the same
                 genes. But even mutations in the same gene may have different
                 biochemical properties and thus different evolutionary
                 consequences. Here we dissect the molecular mechanism of
                 convergent evolution in three lizard species with blanched
                 coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico.
                 These White Sands forms have rapidly evolved cryptic
                 coloration in the last few thousand years, presumably to avoid
                 predation. We use cell-based assays to demonstrate that
                 independent mutations in the same gene underlie the convergent
                 blanched phenotypes in two of the three species. Although the
                 same gene contributes to light phenotypes in these White Sands
                 populations, the specific molecular mechanisms leading to
                 reduced melanin production are different. In one case,
                 mutations affect receptor signaling and in the other, the
                 ability of the receptor to integrate into the melanocyte
                 membrane. These functional differences have important
                 ramifications at the organismal level. Derived alleles in the
                 two species show opposite dominance patterns, which in turn
                 affect their visibility to selection and the spatial
                 distribution of alleles across habitats. Our results
                 demonstrate that even when the same gene is responsible for
                 phenotypic convergence, differences in molecular mechanism can
                 have dramatic consequences on trait expression and ultimately

                 and process because short-term and long-term data have rarely

                 alternative models of phenotypic evolution using a dataset of
                 unprecedented size and temporal span (over 8,000 data points).
                 The data are body-size measurements taken from historical
                 studies, the fossil record, and among-species comparative data
                 representing mammals, squamates, and birds. By analyzing this
                 large dataset, we identify stochastic models that can explain
                 evolutionary patterns on both short and long timescales and
                 reveal a remarkably consistent pattern in the timing of
                 divergence across taxonomic groups. Even though rapid,
                 short-term evolution often occurs in intervals shorter than 1
                 Myr, the changes are constrained and do not accumulate over
                 time. Over longer intervals (1-360 Myr), this pattern of
                 bounded evolution yields to a pattern of increasing divergence
                 with time. The best-fitting model to explain this pattern is a
                 model that combines rare but substantial bursts of phenotypic
                 change with bounded fluctuations on shorter timescales. We
                 suggest that these rare bursts reflect permanent changes in
                 adaptive zones, whereas the short-term fluctuations represent
                 local variations in niche optima due to restricted
