  abstract    = "Darwin's finches are a classic example of species
                 diversification by natural selection. Their impressive
                 variation in beak morphology is associated with the
                 exploitation of a variety of ecological niches, but its
                 developmental basis is unknown. We performed a comparative
                 analysis of expression patterns of various growth factors in
                 species comprising the genus Geospiza. We found that
                 expression of Bmp4 in the mesenchyme of the upper beaks
                 strongly correlated with deep and broad beak morphology. When
                 misexpressed in chicken embryos, Bmp4 caused morphological
                 transformations paralleling the beak morphology of the large
                 ground finch G. magnirostris.",

  abstract    = "There are many striking examples of phenotypic convergence in
                 nature, in some cases associated with changes in the same
                 genes. But even mutations in the same gene may have different
                 biochemical properties and thus different evolutionary
                 consequences. Here we dissect the molecular mechanism of
                 convergent evolution in three lizard species with blanched
                 coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico.
                 These White Sands forms have rapidly evolved cryptic
                 coloration in the last few thousand years, presumably to avoid
                 predation. We use cell-based assays to demonstrate that
                 independent mutations in the same gene underlie the convergent
                 blanched phenotypes in two of the three species. Although the
                 same gene contributes to light phenotypes in these White Sands
                 populations, the specific molecular mechanisms leading to
                 reduced melanin production are different. In one case,
                 mutations affect receptor signaling and in the other, the
                 ability of the receptor to integrate into the melanocyte
                 membrane. These functional differences have important
                 ramifications at the organismal level. Derived alleles in the
                 two species show opposite dominance patterns, which in turn
                 affect their visibility to selection and the spatial
                 distribution of alleles across habitats. Our results
                 demonstrate that even when the same gene is responsible for
                 phenotypic convergence, differences in molecular mechanism can
                 have dramatic consequences on trait expression and ultimately
                 the adaptive trajectory.",
