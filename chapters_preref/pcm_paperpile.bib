  title    = "Phenotypic Evolution by Neutral Mutation",
  author   = "Lynch, Michael and Hill, William G",
  abstract = "A general model is developed for predicting the genetic variance
              within populations and the rate of divergence of population mean
              phenotypes for quantitative traits under the joint operation of
              random sampling drift and mutation in the absence of selection.
              In addition to incorporating the dominance effects of mutant
              alleles, the model yields some insight into the effects of
              linkage and the mating system on the mutational production of
              quantitative-genetic variation. Despite these additional and
              potentially serious complications, it is found that, for small
              populations, the simple predictions obtained by previous
              investigators using additive-genetic models hold reasonably well.
              Even after accounting for dominance and linkage, the equilibrium
              level of genetic variance is unlikely to be much less than 2NVm
              or to be more than 4NVm, where N is the effective population size
              and Vm is the new variance from mutation appearing each
              generation. The rate of increase of the between-line variance per
              generation ultimately equals 2Vm regardless of population size,
              although the time to attain the asymptotic rate is proportional
              to N. Expressions are presented for the rate of approach to the
              equilibrium level of genetic variance and for the expected
              variance of the within-population and between-population genetic
              variances. The relevance of the derived model, which amounts to a
              generalization of the neutral theory to the phenotypic level, is
              discussed in the context of the detection of natural selection,
              the maintenance of pure lines for biomedical and agricultural
              purposes, the development of genetic conservation programs, and

@BOOK{Hedges2009-lj,

  author    = "Hedges, B S and Kumar, Sudhir",
  abstract  = "The evolutionary history of life includes two primary
               components: phylogeny and timescale. Phylogeny refers to the
               branching order (relationships) of species or other taxa within
               a group and is crucial for understanding the inheritance of
               traits and for erecting classifications. However, a timescale is
               equally important because it provides a way to compare phylogeny
               directly with the evolution of other organisms and with
               planetary history such as geology, climate, extraterrestrial
               impacts, and other features. The Timetree of Life is the first
               reference book to synthesize the wealth of information relating
               to the temporal component of phylogenetic trees. In the past,
               biologists have relied exclusively upon the fossil record to
               infer an evolutionary timescale. However, recent revolutionary
               advances in molecular biology have made it possible to not only
               estimate the relationships of many groups of organisms, but also
               to estimate their times of divergence with molecular clocks. The
               routine estimation and utilization of these so-called
               'time-trees' could add exciting new dimensions to biology
               including enhanced opportunities to integrate large molecular
               data sets with fossil and biogeographic evidence (and thereby
               foster greater communication between molecular and traditional
               systematists). They could help estimate not only ancestral
               character states but also evolutionary rates in numerous
               categories of organismal phenotype; establish more reliable
               associations between causal historical processes and biological
               outcomes; develop a universally standardized scheme for
               biological classifications; and generally promote novel avenues
               of thought in many arenas of comparative evolutionary biology.
               This authoritative reference work brings together, for the first
               time, experts on all major groups of organisms to assemble a
               timetree of life. The result is a comprehensive resource on
               evolutionary history which will be an indispensable reference
               for scientists, educators, and students in the life sciences,
               earth sciences, and molecular biology. For each major group of
               organism, a representative is illustrated and a timetree of
               families and higher taxonomic groups is shown. Basic aspects of
               the evolutionary history of the group, the fossil record, and
               competing hypotheses of relationships are discussed. Details of
               the divergence times are presented for each node in the
               timetree, and primary literature references are included. The
               book is complemented by an online database (www.timetree.net)

                 problem [1, 2]. The evolution of reproductive isolation in
                 sympatry is rare, relying on strong selection along steep
                 ecological gradients [3-7]. Improved wintering conditions
                 owing to human activities promoted the recent establishment of
                 a migratory divide in Central European blackcaps (Sylvia
                 atricapilla) [8, 9]. Here, we show that differential migratory
                 orientation facilitated reproductive isolation of sympatric
                 populations within <30 generations. The genetic divergence in
                 sympatry exceeds that of allopatric blackcaps separated by 800
                 km and is associated with diverse phenotypic divergence.
                 Blackcaps migrating along the shorter northwestern route have
                 rounder wings and narrower beaks and differ in beak and
                 plumage color from sympatric southwest-migrating birds. We
                 suggest that distinct wing and beak morphologies are
                 ecomorphological adaptations resulting from divergent,
                 multifarious selection regimes during migration. We
                 hypothesize that restricted gene flow accelerates the
                 evolution of adaptive phenotypic divergence toward the
                 contrasting selection regimes. Similar adaptive processes can
                 occur in more than 50 bird species that recently changed their
                 migratory behavior [10, 11] or in species with low migratory
                 connectivity. Our study thus illustrates how ecological
                 changes can rapidly drive the contemporary evolution of
                 ecotypes.",

  author   = "Newton, Michael A and Raftery, Adrian E",
  abstract = "We introduce the weighted likelihood bootstrap (WLB) as a way to
              simulate approximately from a posterior distribution. This method
              is often easy to implement, requiring only an algorithm for
              calculating the maximum likelihood estimator, such as iteratively
              reweighted least squares. In the generic weighting scheme, the
              WLB is first order correct under quite general conditions.
              Inaccuracies can be removed by using the WLB as a source of
              samples in the sampling-importance resampling (SIR) algorithm,
              which also allows incorporation of particular prior information.
              The SIR-adjusted WLB can be a competitive alternative to other
              integration methods in certain models. Asymptotic expansions
              elucidate the second-order properties of the WLB, which is a
              generalization of Rubin's Bayesian bootstrap. The calculation of
              approximate Bayes factors for model comparison is also
              considered. We note that, given a sample simulated from the
              posterior distribution, the required marginal likelihood may be
              simulation consistently estimated by the harmonic mean of the
              associated likelihood values; a modification of this estimator
              that avoids instability is also noted. These methods provide

               data. These methods allow the data-based selection of a ``best''

               that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to
               be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such

                 interordinal splits occurred during the Cretaceous, a major
                 therian radiation was then underway. This claim conflicts with
                 statistical evidence from the well-sampled latest Cretaceous

                 and that a massive diversification took place during the early

                 data show that Cretaceous mammals were on average small and

                 Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction, there was a rapid and

                 extinction leaves a characteristic signature in the shape of
                 molecular phylogenetic trees, many studies have used data from
                 extant taxa only to infer extinction rates. This is a
                 promising approach for the large number of taxa for which

                 assumption made by studies of extinction from phylogenetic

                 lineages, simple estimators based on the birth-death process
                 are unable to recover true extinction rates. This is

                 consisting of a molecular phylogeny with branch lengths and
                 trait measurements from extant taxa. These kinds of approaches
                 ignore historical evidence for evolutionary pattern and
                 process contained in the fossil record. In this article, we
                 show through simulation that incorporation of fossil

                 among models of quantitative trait evolution using comparative
                 data. We further suggest a novel Bayesian approach that allows
                 fossil information to be integrated even when explicit
                 phylogenetic hypotheses are lacking for extinct
                 representatives of extant clades. By applying this approach to
                 a comparative dataset comprising body sizes for caniform

              assume that the points are drawn independently from a common
              distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny,
              they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method

              and extinction are very similar. Using these minimal constraints,

  abstract = "A comparison of the evolutionary rates of cranial morphology in
              mammals with the neutral expectation suggests that stabilizing
              selection is a predominant evolutionary force keeping the
              long-term diversification of lineages well below its potential.
              The rate of morphological divergence of almost all lineages,
              including the great apes, is substantially below the minimum
              neutral expectation. The divergence of the modern races of man is
              slightly above the minimum neutral rate but well below the
              maximum rate. Therefore, there is no need to invoke extraordinary
              mutational mechanisms, such as regulatory gene evolution, to
              explain what has been perceived as rapid morphological evolution
              in mammals. Nor does it appear that behavioral drive needs to be
              invoked to explain rapid morphological evolution in hominoids.
              Outside of man, the long-term rate of phenotypic evolution in the
              great apes is actually lower than that for other mammals. The
              data suggest that, immediately after reproductive isolation, most
              lineages diverge morphologically at approximately the neutral
              rate and that this rate declines over evolutionary time. Such a
              pattern is consistent with a broad class of phenotypic
              evolutionary models that invoke an interaction between the forces
              of random genetic drift, polygenic mutation, and stabilizing
              selection. This pattern also suggests that the apparently rapid
              rates of morphological evolution in modern man relative to other

@ARTICLE{Lande1976-ol,
  title    = "Natural Selection and Random Genetic Drift in Phenotypic
              Evolution",
  author   = "Lande, Russell",
  abstract = "The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which
              will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events
              than the classical models of population genetics. This is
              accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic
              parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful
              in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems that
              in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations this
              can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of adaptive
              zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive topography
              for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive topography for gene
              frequencies. This shows that for most phenotypic characters under
              natural selection, the evolution of the average phenotype in a
              population is always toward an adaptive zone of high mean fitness
              (W̄) in the phenotype space. Frequency-dependent selection may
              cause the average phenotype to evolve away from its adaptive
              zone, decreasing the mean fitness of individuals in the
              population; different types of frequency-dependent selection are
              classified as to whether or not they lead to such maladaptive
              evolution. A simple formula for estimating the minimum selective
              mortality per generation necessary to explain observed rates of
              phenotypic evolution is derived (assuming that genetic drift was
              not involved). The minimum mortality rates needed to explain
              observed rates of evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary
              mammals are very small, typically about one selective death per
              million individuals per generation. This leads to consideration
              of the hypothesis that these changes were caused by random
              genetic drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the
              observed evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have
              occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations,
              with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such
              statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the
              adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain.
              Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a
              selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have
              been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that if
              stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is not
              very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones may be
              an important mechanism of evolution in populations of effective
              size in the hundreds or thousands. These results support the
              contention that random genetic drift may play a significant role
              in phenotypic evolution.",

               One of the best-studied examples involves Caribbean Anolis
               lizards. With about 400 species, Anolis has played an important

                 nature, in some cases associated with changes in the same
                 genes. But even mutations in the same gene may have different
                 biochemical properties and thus different evolutionary
                 consequences. Here we dissect the molecular mechanism of
                 convergent evolution in three lizard species with blanched
                 coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico.
                 These White Sands forms have rapidly evolved cryptic
                 coloration in the last few thousand years, presumably to avoid
                 predation. We use cell-based assays to demonstrate that
                 independent mutations in the same gene underlie the convergent
                 blanched phenotypes in two of the three species. Although the
                 same gene contributes to light phenotypes in these White Sands
                 populations, the specific molecular mechanisms leading to
                 reduced melanin production are different. In one case,
                 mutations affect receptor signaling and in the other, the
                 ability of the receptor to integrate into the melanocyte
                 membrane. These functional differences have important
                 ramifications at the organismal level. Derived alleles in the
                 two species show opposite dominance patterns, which in turn
                 affect their visibility to selection and the spatial
                 distribution of alleles across habitats. Our results
                 demonstrate that even when the same gene is responsible for
                 phenotypic convergence, differences in molecular mechanism can
                 have dramatic consequences on trait expression and ultimately

                 and process because short-term and long-term data have rarely
                 been combined into a single analytical framework. Here we test
                 alternative models of phenotypic evolution using a dataset of
                 unprecedented size and temporal span (over 8,000 data points).
                 The data are body-size measurements taken from historical
                 studies, the fossil record, and among-species comparative data
                 representing mammals, squamates, and birds. By analyzing this
                 large dataset, we identify stochastic models that can explain
                 evolutionary patterns on both short and long timescales and
                 reveal a remarkably consistent pattern in the timing of
                 divergence across taxonomic groups. Even though rapid,
                 short-term evolution often occurs in intervals shorter than 1
                 Myr, the changes are constrained and do not accumulate over
                 time. Over longer intervals (1-360 Myr), this pattern of
                 bounded evolution yields to a pattern of increasing divergence
                 with time. The best-fitting model to explain this pattern is a
                 model that combines rare but substantial bursts of phenotypic
                 change with bounded fluctuations on shorter timescales. We
                 suggest that these rare bursts reflect permanent changes in
                 adaptive zones, whereas the short-term fluctuations represent
                 local variations in niche optima due to restricted
                 environmental variation within a stable adaptive zone.",

                 efforts in that we use explicit models of evolutionary
                 process, with parameters estimated from contemporary
                 populations, to analyze a large sample of divergence data on
                 many different timescales. We show that one quantitative
                 genetic model yields a good fit to data on phenotypic
                 divergence across timescales ranging from a few generations to
                 10 million generations. The key feature of this model is a
                 fitness optimum that moves within fixed limits. Conversely, a
                 model of neutral evolution, models with a stationary optimum

              genetic variation. Lande proposed that high levels of heritable
              variation may be maintained by mutation in the face of
              stabilizing selection. Several analyses have appeared of two
              distinct models with n additive polygenic loci subject to
              mutation and stabilizing selection. Each is reviewed and a new
              analysis and model are presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed
              extensions of a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes
              a continuum of possible allelic effects at each locus. Latter and
              Bulmer analyzed a model with diallelic loci. The published
              analyses of these models lead to qualitatively different
              predictions concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic
              variance on the underlying biological parameters. A new
              asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows that the different
              predictions are not consequences of the number of alleles assumed
              but rather are attributable to assumptions concerning the
              relative magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the phenotypic
              effects of mutation, and the intensity of selection. This
              conclusion is reinforced by analysis of a model with triallelic
              loci. None of the approximate analyses presented are
              mathematically rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display
              the domains of validity for alternative approximations,
              numerically determined equilibria are presented. In addition,
              empirical estimates of mutation rates and selection intensity are
              reviewed, revealing weaknesses in both the data and its
              connection to the models. Although the mathematical results and
              underlying biological requirements of my analyses are quite
              different from those of Lande , the results do not refute his
              hypothesis that considerable additive genetic variance may be
              maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I argue that
              the validity of this hypothesis can only be determined with
