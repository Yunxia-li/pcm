  abstract    = "Replicate radiations provide powerful comparative systems to
                 address questions about the interplay between opportunity and
                 innovation in driving episodes of diversification and the
                 factors limiting their subsequent progression. However, such
                 systems have been rarely documented at intercontinental
                 scales. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis of multiple
                 radiations in the genus Lupinus (Leguminosae), which exhibits
                 some of the highest known rates of net diversification in
                 plants. Given that incomplete taxon sampling, background
                 extinction, and lineage-specific variation in diversification
                 rates can confound macroevolutionary inferences regarding the
                 timing and mechanisms of cladogenesis, we used Bayesian
                 relaxed clock phylogenetic analyses as well as MEDUSA and
                 BiSSE birth-death likelihood models of diversification, to
                 evaluate the evolutionary patterns of lineage accumulation in
                 Lupinus. We identified 3 significant shifts to increased rates
                 of net diversification (r) relative to background levels in
                 the genus (r = 0.18-0.48 lineages/myr). The primary shift
                 occurred approximately 4.6 Ma (r = 0.48-1.76) in the montane
                 regions of western North America, followed by a secondary
                 shift approximately 2.7 Ma (r = 0.89-3.33) associated with
                 range expansion and diversification of allopatrically
                 distributed sister clades in the Mexican highlands and Andes.
                 We also recovered evidence for a third independent shift
                 approximately 6.5 Ma at the base of a lower elevation eastern
                 South American grassland and campo rupestre clade (r =
                 0.36-1.33). Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions and BiSSE
                 likelihood analyses of correlated diversification indicated
                 that increased rates of speciation are strongly associated
                 with the derived evolution of perennial life history and
                 invasion of montane ecosystems. Although we currently lack
                 hard evidence for ``replicate adaptive radiations'' in the
                 sense of convergent morphological and ecological trajectories
                 among species in different clades, these results are
                 consistent with the hypothesis that iteroparity functioned as
                 an adaptive key innovation, providing a mechanism for range
                 expansion and rapid divergence in upper elevation regions

                 time period to the recent cichlid fish radiations, which are
                 an order of magnitude faster than documented bird, arthropod,
                 and plant radiations, we focus on the high-altitude flora of
                 the Andes, which is the most species-rich of any tropical
                 mountains. Because of the recent uplift of the northern Andes,
                 the upland environments where much of this rich endemic flora
                 is found have been available for colonization only since the
                 late Pliocene or Pleistocene, 2-4 million years (Myr) ago.
                 Using DNA sequence data we identify a monophyletic group
                 within the genus Lupinus representing 81 species endemic to
                 the Andes. The age of this clade is estimated to be 1.18-1.76
                 Myr, implying a diversification rate of 2.49-3.72 species per
                 Myr. This exceeds previous estimates for plants, providing the
                 most spectacular example of explosive plant species
                 diversification documented to date. Furthermore, it suggests
                 that the high cichlid diversification rates are not unique.
                 Lack of key innovations associated with the Andean Lupinus
                 clade suggests that diversification was driven by ecological
                 opportunities afforded by the emergence of island-like
                 habitats after Andean uplift. Data from other genera indicate
                 that lupines are one of a set of similarly rapid Andean plant
                 radiations, continental in scale and island-like in stimulus,
                 suggesting that the high-elevation Andean flora provides a

                 understanding rapid species diversification.",

  author    = "Raup, David M and Gould, Stephen Jay",
  abstract  = "The morphological order of evolutionary trees has been the
               traditional argument for the operation of directional causes in
               macroevolution. We show, in this work, that a similar order can
               be generated within stochastic systems bounded by minimal
               biological constraints. Our system generates an evolutionary
               tree by making random decisions about each lineage in each time
               interval given preset probabilities for branching, extinction
               and persistence (Raup, Gould, Schopf, and Simberloff, 1973).
               Morphology is determined in an independent and equally
               stochastic manner. Using ten hypothetical characters, the
               beginning lineage is given an all zero morphology. At each
               branching point, each character may change by one unit (in a
               positive or negative direction) according to preset
               probabilities for positive change, negative change, and no
               change. Our simulations display most of the ordered features
               generally associated with uni-directional selection:
               morphological coherence of monophyletic groups and incomplete
               filling of ``morphological space'' regular ``unfolding'' of
               morphology (as seen in strong correspondence between phenetic
               and cladistic taxonomies); marked evolutionary ``trends'' strong
               correlation among characters; large variation in rates of
               evolution; and specialization of derived forms. We attribute
               much of this order to abstract topological properties of the
               tree itself and urge that the data for inferences about
               directional causes be sought elsewhere (in functional
               morphology, for example). We suggest, with caution, that
               undirected selection may be the rule rather than the exception
               in nature, if a temporal unit of sufficient duration be used as

                 using 73 dated molecular phylogenies. Based on our sample, we

                 the effects of species range contraction and expansion that
                 may have resulted from the well-documented climatic changes

                 Paleontological data show that older marine invasions have

              and phylogenetic comparative methods to test the relative

               the most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to
               this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the

               precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and
               because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven
               highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic
               classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to
               phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent
               and predictable pattern from which the total number of species

                 attempting to reconstruct phenotypes for the long extinct
                 ancestors of living species. Various methods have been
                 developed to do this on a phylogeny from the data for extant
                 taxa. In the present article, I introduce a new approach for
                 ancestral character estimation for discretely valued traits.
                 This approach is based on the threshold model from
                 evolutionary quantitative genetics. Under the threshold model,
                 the value exhibited by an individual or species for a discrete
                 character is determined by an underlying, unobserved
                 continuous trait called ``liability.'' In this new method for
                 ancestral state reconstruction, I use Bayesian Markov chain
                 Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the liabilities of ancestral and
                 tip species, and the relative positions of two or more
                 thresholds, from their joint posterior probability
                 distribution. Using data simulated under the model, I find
                 that the method has very good performance in ancestral
                 character estimation. Use of the threshold model for ancestral
                 state reconstruction relies on a priori specification of the
                 order of the discrete character states along the liability
                 axis. I test the use of a Bayesian MCMC information theoretic
                 criterion based approach to choose among different
                 hypothesized orderings for the discrete character. Finally, I

               the state of a particular character has been of long-standing
               interest to evolutionary biologists. To assess the effect of a
               character on diversification rates using likelihood methods
               requires that we be able to calculate the probability that a
               group of extant species would have evolved as observed, given a
               particular model of the character's effect. Here we describe how
               to calculate this probability for a phylogenetic tree and a
               two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution
               (the ``BiSSE'' model, binary-state speciation and extinction).
               The model involves six parameters, specifying two speciation
               rates (rate when the lineage is in state 0; rate when in state
               1), two extinction rates (when in state 0; when in state 1), and
               two rates of character state change (from 0 to 1, and from 1 to
               0). Using these probability calculations, we can do maximum
               likelihood inference to estimate the model's parameters and
               perform hypothesis tests (e.g., is the rate of speciation
               elevated for one character state over the other?). We

                 used to model the evolution of two-state discrete characters
                 along a phylogeny. The model assumes that there is a
                 quantitative character, called liability, that is unobserved
                 and that determines the discrete character according to
                 whether the liability exceeds a threshold value. A Markov

                 sampling liability values consistent with the phylogeny and
                 with the observed data. The same approach can also be used for
                 continuous characters by assuming that the tip species have
                 values that have been observed. In this way, one can make a

                 primitive states. Anurans (frogs and toads) exhibit a
                 remarkable diversity of reproductive modes that is unique
                 among terrestrial vertebrates. Here, we analyze the evolution

                 matched life-history database of 720 species, including most

                 and aquatic larvae often precede direct development
                 (terrestrial egg, no tadpole stage), but surprisingly, direct
                 development evolves directly from aquatic breeding nearly as
                 often. Modes with primitive exotrophic larvae (feeding outside
                 the egg) frequently give rise to direct developers, whereas
                 those with nonfeeding larvae (endotrophic) do not. Similarly,
                 modes with eggs and larvae placed in locations protected from
                 aquatic predators evolve frequently but rarely give rise to
                 direct developers. Thus, frogs frequently bypass many
                 seemingly intermediate stages in the evolution of direct
                 development. We also find significant associations between

               hormonally-primed Iberian midwife toads, Alytes cisternasii. In
               this species, pairing and fertilization are terrestrial. The
               male cares for the developing embryos on land, carrying them
               twined around his hind limbs until they hatch into tadpoles
               which he releases into water; his investment in the offspring
               then ends. The courtship of A. cisternasii can be divided into a
               pre- and post-ovulatory phase. An encounter is initiated when
               the female approaches the male and is clasped by him in inguinal
               amplexus. Both the male and the female produce vocalizations
               during the period prior to the initiation of amplexus. During
               amplexus, only the female vocalizes, changing her call to one
               that is of lower intensity, longer duration and more regularly
               emitted than before. During inguinal amplexus, the male engages
               in bouts of intense pedalling and gentle rocking behaviour, each
               bout being initiated when the female repositions herself beneath
               him. Rocking and pedalling cease when the female ovulates, at
               which time she exhibits a posture that we call Unkenkrampf.
               Ovulation occurs at this time, and is followed by sperm release
               by the male (seen as a series of lateral compressions of his
               body). After sperm release, the male moves forwards to engage
               the female in cervical amplexus and then manoeuvres his hind
               limbs such that the egg string becomes tangled around his
               ankles. The female may exhibit additional episodes of
               Unkenkrampf during this period, but these are not accompanied by
               further egg release. Episodes of Unkenkrampf (without ovulation)
               also may occur after the male dismounts from the female. Similar
               behaviour patterns to those observed in the laboratory are seen
               in natural populations of A. cisternasii. We compare and
               contrast our observations of A. cisternasii with those of other

              egg/clutch characteristics, oviposition site, larval development,
              and sometimes, parental care. Two evident patterns in the
              evolution of these traits are the higher diversity of
              reproductive modes in the tropics and the apparent progression
              from aquatic to terrestrial reproduction, often attributed to
              higher fitness resulting from decreased predation on terrestrial
              eggs and tadpoles. Here, we propose that sexual selection-and not
              only natural selection due to predation-favors terrestrial
              breeding by reducing the loss of fitness due to polyandry. To
              examine this novel selective mechanism, we reconstructed the
              evolution of reproductive diversity in two frog families (Hylidae
              and Leptodactylidae) and tested for concerted evolution of egg
              and tadpole development sites with specific mating behaviors. We
              found that oviposition and tadpole development sites are evolving
              independently, do not show the same diversity and/or
              directionality in terms of terrestriality, and thus may be
              diversifying due to different selective mechanisms. In both
              families, terrestrial egg deposition is correlated with amplexus
              that is hidden from competing males, and in hylids, testes mass
              was significantly larger and more variable in males with exposed
              amplexus that are vulnerable to polyandry. Our results indicate

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The extant squamates (>9400 known species of
                 lizards and snakes) are one of the most diverse and
                 conspicuous radiations of terrestrial vertebrates, but no
                 studies have attempted to reconstruct a phylogeny for the
                 group with large-scale taxon sampling. Such an estimate is
                 invaluable for comparative evolutionary studies, and to
                 address their classification. Here, we present the first
                 large-scale phylogenetic estimate for Squamata. RESULTS: The
                 estimated phylogeny contains 4161 species, representing all
                 currently recognized families and subfamilies. The analysis is
                 based on up to 12896 base pairs of sequence data per species
                 (average = 2497 bp) from 12 genes, including seven nuclear
                 loci (BDNF, c-mos, NT3, PDC, R35, RAG-1, and RAG-2), and five
                 mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S, cytochrome b, ND2, and ND4).
                 The tree provides important confirmation for recent estimates
                 of higher-level squamate phylogeny based on molecular data
                 (but with more limited taxon sampling), estimates that are
                 very different from previous morphology-based hypotheses. The
                 tree also includes many relationships that differ from
                 previous molecular estimates and many that differ from
                 traditional taxonomy. CONCLUSIONS: We present a new
                 large-scale phylogeny of squamate reptiles that should be a
                 valuable resource for future comparative studies. We also
                 present a revised classification of squamates at the family
                 and subfamily level to bring the taxonomy more in line with
                 the new phylogenetic hypothesis. This classification includes
                 new, resurrected, and modified subfamilies within
                 gymnophthalmid and scincid lizards, and boid, colubrid, and

                 fundamental and largely unanswered question in evolutionary
                 biology is why some clades diversify primarily in some of
                 these components and not others. Dramatic variation in trunk
                 vertebral numbers (14 to >300) among squamate reptiles
                 coincides with different body shapes, and snake-like body
                 shapes have evolved numerous times. However, whether increased
                 evolutionary rates or numbers of vertebrae underlie body shape
                 and taxonomic diversification is unknown. Using a supertree of
                 squamates including 1375 species, and corresponding vertebral
                 and body shape data, we show that increased rates of evolution
                 in vertebral numbers have coincided with increased rates and
                 disparity in body shape evolution, but not changes in rates of
                 taxonomic diversification. We also show that the evolution of
                 many vertebrae has not spurred or inhibited body shape or
                 taxonomic diversification, suggesting that increased vertebral
                 number is not a key innovation. Our findings demonstrate that
                 lineage attributes such as the relaxation of constraints on
                 vertebral number can facilitate the evolution of novel body
                 shapes, but that different factors are responsible for body

                 We explore the historical ecology of squamates (lizards and
                 snakes), identify historically derived differences among
                 clades, and examine how this history has affected present-day
                 squamate assemblages globally. A dietary shift occurred in the
                 evolutionary history of squamates. Iguanian diets contain
                 large proportions of ants, other hymenopterans, and beetles,
                 whereas these are minor prey in scleroglossan lizards. A
                 preponderance of termites, grasshoppers, spiders, and insect
                 larvae in their diets suggests that scleroglossan lizards
                 harvest higher energy prey or avoid prey containing noxious
                 chemicals. The success of this dietary shift is suggested by
                 dominance of scleroglossans in lizard assemblages throughout
                 the world. One scleroglossan clade, Autarchoglossa, combined
                 an advanced vomeronasal chemosensory system with jaw
                 prehension and increased activity levels. We suggest these
                 traits provided them a competitive advantage during the day in
                 terrestrial habitats. Iguanians and gekkotans shifted to
                 elevated microhabitats historically, and gekkotans shifted
                 activity to nighttime. These historically derived niche
                 differences are apparent in extant lizard assemblages and
                 account for some observed structure. These patterns occur in a

                 differences in the rate of trait-evolutionary change across
                 lineages. Despite this continued interest, we still lack
                 methods for identifying shifts in evolutionary rates on the
                 growing tree of life while accommodating uncertainty in the
                 evolutionary process. Here we introduce a Bayesian approach
                 for identifying complex patterns in the evolution of
                 continuous traits. The method (auteur) uses reversible-jump
                 Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to more fully characterize
                 the complexity of trait evolution, considering models that
                 range in complexity from those with a single global rate to
                 potentially ones in which each branch in the tree has its own
                 independent rate. This newly introduced approach performs well
                 in recovering simulated rate shifts and simulated rates for
                 datasets nearing the size typical for comparative phylogenetic
                 study (i.e., $\geq$64 tips). Analysis of two large empirical
                 datasets of vertebrate body size reveal overwhelming support
                 for multiple-rate models of evolution, and we observe
                 exceptionally high rates of body-size evolution in a group of
                 emydid turtles relative to their evolutionary background.

              relationships between species (phylogeny) combined with
              comparative information for phenotypic traits to draw model-based
              statistical inferences about the evolutionary past. Recent years
              have seen phylogeny methods for evolutionary inference become
              central in the study of organic evolution. * Here, I present two
              different graphical methods for visualizing phenotypic evolution
              on the tree. Method 1 is a new approach for plotting the
              posterior density of stochastically mapped character histories
              for a binary (two-state) phenotypic trait on a phylogeny. Method
              2 is a closely related technique that uses ancestral character
              estimation to visualize historical character states for a
              continuous trait along the branches of a tree. * One shortcoming
              of Method 2 is that by mapping the point estimates of ancestral
              states along the branches of the tree, we have effectively
              ignored the uncertainty associated with ancestral character
              estimation of continuous traits. To alleviate this issue, I
              propose a new method for visualizing ancestral state uncertainty
              using a type of projection of the tree into morphospace called a
              `traitgram.' * All of these approaches should prove useful in
              summarizing complex comparative inferences about ancestral
              character reconstruction. They are implemented in the freely

                 systems and secondary sexual traits. In semi-precocial
                 species, chicks are reliant on the parents for feeding, but in
                 precocial species the chicks feed themselves. Thus, where the
                 parents are emancipated from feeding the young, we predict

                 precocial development not only allows rapid divergence of

                 rapid diversification of secondary sexual characters, most

               that most morphological change in species takes place in rapid

               the theory in 1972, as an alternative to the idea that
               morphological change slowly accumulates in the course of time, a
               then common belief they dubbed `phyletic gradualism'. Ever since

                 significantly on the structure of the data. We describe a

  abstract    = "Despite the many triumphs of comparative biology during the
                 past few decades, the field has remained strangely divorced
                 from evolutionary genetics. In particular, comparative methods
                 have failed to incorporate multivariate process models of
                 microevolution that include genetic constraint in the form of
                 the G matrix. Here we explore the insights that might be
                 gained by such an analysis. A neutral model of evolution by
                 genetic drift that depends on effective population size and
                 the G matrix predicts a probability distribution for
                 divergence of population trait means on a phylogeny. Use of a
                 maximum likelihood (ML) framework then allows us to compare
                 independent direct estimates of G with the ML estimates based
                 on the observed pattern of trait divergence among taxa. We
                 assess the departure from neutrality, and thus the role of
                 different types of selection and other forces, in a stepwise
                 hypothesis-testing procedure based on parameters for the size,
                 shape, and orientation of G. We illustrate our approach with a

                 related species to retain some phenotypic similarities due to
                 their shared evolutionary histories. The amount of expected
                 similarity depends both on the hierarchical phylogenetic
                 structure, and on the specific magnitude and types of
                 evolutionary changes that accumulate during each generation.
                 In this study, we show how models of microevolutionary change
                 can be translated into the resulting macroevolutionary
                 patterns. We illustrate how the structure of phenotypic
                 covariances expected in interspecific measurements can be
                 derived, and how this structure depends on the
                 microevolutionary forces guiding phenotypic change at each
                 generation. We then explore the covariance structure expected
                 from several simple microevolutionary models of phenotypic
                 evolution, including various combinations of random genetic
                 drift, directional selection, stabilizing selection, and
                 environmental change, as well as models of punctuated or
                 burst-like evolution. We find that stabilizing selection leads
                 to patterns of exponential decrease of between species
                 covariance with phylogenetic distance. This is different from
                 the usual linear patterns of decrease assumed in most
                 comparative and systematic methods. Nevertheless, linear
                 patterns of decrease can result from many processes in
                 addition to random genetic drift, such as directional and
                 fluctuating selection as well as modes of punctuated change.

              phenotypes for quantitative traits under the joint operation of
              random sampling drift and mutation in the absence of selection.
              In addition to incorporating the dominance effects of mutant
              alleles, the model yields some insight into the effects of
              linkage and the mating system on the mutational production of
              quantitative-genetic variation. Despite these additional and
              potentially serious complications, it is found that, for small
              populations, the simple predictions obtained by previous
              investigators using additive-genetic models hold reasonably well.
              Even after accounting for dominance and linkage, the equilibrium
              level of genetic variance is unlikely to be much less than 2NVm
              or to be more than 4NVm, where N is the effective population size
              and Vm is the new variance from mutation appearing each
              generation. The rate of increase of the between-line variance per
              generation ultimately equals 2Vm regardless of population size,
              although the time to attain the asymptotic rate is proportional
              to N. Expressions are presented for the rate of approach to the
              equilibrium level of genetic variance and for the expected
              variance of the within-population and between-population genetic
              variances. The relevance of the derived model, which amounts to a
              generalization of the neutral theory to the phenotypic level, is

  abstract  = "The evolutionary history of life includes two primary
               components: phylogeny and timescale. Phylogeny refers to the
               branching order (relationships) of species or other taxa within
               a group and is crucial for understanding the inheritance of
               traits and for erecting classifications. However, a timescale is
               equally important because it provides a way to compare phylogeny
               directly with the evolution of other organisms and with
               planetary history such as geology, climate, extraterrestrial
               impacts, and other features. The Timetree of Life is the first
               reference book to synthesize the wealth of information relating
               to the temporal component of phylogenetic trees. In the past,
               biologists have relied exclusively upon the fossil record to
               infer an evolutionary timescale. However, recent revolutionary
               advances in molecular biology have made it possible to not only
               estimate the relationships of many groups of organisms, but also
               to estimate their times of divergence with molecular clocks. The
               routine estimation and utilization of these so-called
               'time-trees' could add exciting new dimensions to biology
               including enhanced opportunities to integrate large molecular
               data sets with fossil and biogeographic evidence (and thereby
               foster greater communication between molecular and traditional
               systematists). They could help estimate not only ancestral
               character states but also evolutionary rates in numerous
               categories of organismal phenotype; establish more reliable
               associations between causal historical processes and biological
               outcomes; develop a universally standardized scheme for
               biological classifications; and generally promote novel avenues
               of thought in many arenas of comparative evolutionary biology.
               This authoritative reference work brings together, for the first
               time, experts on all major groups of organisms to assemble a
               timetree of life. The result is a comprehensive resource on

               for scientists, educators, and students in the life sciences,
               earth sciences, and molecular biology. For each major group of

                 problem [1, 2]. The evolution of reproductive isolation in
                 sympatry is rare, relying on strong selection along steep
                 ecological gradients [3-7]. Improved wintering conditions
                 owing to human activities promoted the recent establishment of
                 a migratory divide in Central European blackcaps (Sylvia
                 atricapilla) [8, 9]. Here, we show that differential migratory
                 orientation facilitated reproductive isolation of sympatric
                 populations within <30 generations. The genetic divergence in
                 sympatry exceeds that of allopatric blackcaps separated by 800
                 km and is associated with diverse phenotypic divergence.
                 Blackcaps migrating along the shorter northwestern route have
                 rounder wings and narrower beaks and differ in beak and
                 plumage color from sympatric southwest-migrating birds. We

                 ecomorphological adaptations resulting from divergent,
                 multifarious selection regimes during migration. We
                 hypothesize that restricted gene flow accelerates the
                 evolution of adaptive phenotypic divergence toward the
                 contrasting selection regimes. Similar adaptive processes can
                 occur in more than 50 bird species that recently changed their
                 migratory behavior [10, 11] or in species with low migratory
                 connectivity. Our study thus illustrates how ecological

                 evolution has greatly increased with the advent of large-scale
                 phylogenetic comparative methods. Widely used
                 Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) models can describe an adaptive
                 process of divergence and selection. However, inference of the
                 dynamics of adaptive landscapes from comparative data is
                 complicated by interpretational difficulties, lack of
                 identifiability among parameter values and the common
                 requirement that adaptive hypotheses must be assigned a
                 priori. Here, we develop a reversible-jump Bayesian method of
                 fitting multi-optima OU models to phylogenetic comparative
                 data that estimates the placement and magnitude of adaptive
                 shifts directly from the data. We show how biologically
                 informed hypotheses can be tested against this inferred
                 posterior of shift locations using Bayes Factors to establish
                 whether our a priori models adequately describe the dynamics
                 of adaptive peak shifts. Furthermore, we show how the
                 inclusion of informative priors can be used to restrict models
                 to biologically realistic parameter space and test particular
                 biological interpretations of evolutionary models. We argue
                 that Bayesian model fitting of OU models to comparative data
                 provides a framework for integrating of multiple sources of
                 biological data-such as microevolutionary estimates of

              model (GLM) is presented for the analysis of comparative data,
              which can be used to address questions regarding the relationship
              between traits or between traits and environments, the rate of
              phenotypic evolution, the degree of phylogenetic effect, and the
              ancestral state of a character. Our approach thus emphasizes the
              similarity among evolutionary questions asked in comparative
              studies. We then discuss ways of specifying the sources of error
              involved in a comparative study (e.g., measurement error, error
              due to evolution along a phylogeny, error due to misspecification

              simulate approximately from a posterior distribution. This method
              is often easy to implement, requiring only an algorithm for
              calculating the maximum likelihood estimator, such as iteratively
              reweighted least squares. In the generic weighting scheme, the
              WLB is first order correct under quite general conditions.
              Inaccuracies can be removed by using the WLB as a source of
              samples in the sampling-importance resampling (SIR) algorithm,
              which also allows incorporation of particular prior information.
              The SIR-adjusted WLB can be a competitive alternative to other
              integration methods in certain models. Asymptotic expansions
              elucidate the second-order properties of the WLB, which is a
              generalization of Rubin's Bayesian bootstrap. The calculation of
              approximate Bayes factors for model comparison is also
              considered. We note that, given a sample simulated from the

              simulation consistently estimated by the harmonic mean of the
              associated likelihood values; a modification of this estimator

               data. These methods allow the data-based selection of a ``best''

               be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such

               advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second

                 common post-Cretaceous ancestor. Nonetheless, several recent

                 interordinal splits occurred during the Cretaceous, a major
                 therian radiation was then underway. This claim conflicts with
                 statistical evidence from the well-sampled latest Cretaceous
                 and Cenozoic North American fossil record. Paleofaunal data

                 and that a massive diversification took place during the early

                 data show that Cretaceous mammals were on average small and

                 Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction, there was a rapid and

                 molecular phylogenetic trees, many studies have used data from
                 extant taxa only to infer extinction rates. This is a
                 promising approach for the large number of taxa for which

                 are unable to recover true extinction rates. This is

               for the field. Computational Molecular Evolution provides an
               up-to-date and comprehensive coverage of modern statistical and
               computational methods used in molecular evolutionary analysis,
               such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. Yang
               describes the models, methods and algorithms that are most
               useful for analysing the ever-increasing supply of molecular
               sequence data, with a view to furthering our understanding of
               the evolution of genes and genomes. The book emphasizes
               essential concepts rather than mathematical proofs. It includes
               detailed derivations and implementation details, as well as
               numerous illustrations, worked examples, and exercises. It will
               be of relevance and use to students and professional researchers
               (both empiricists and theoreticians) in the fields of molecular
               phylogenetics, evolutionary biology, population genetics,
               mathematics, statistics and computer science. Biologists who
               have used phylogenetic software programs to analyze their own
               data will find the book particularly rewarding, although it
               should appeal to anyone seeking an authoritative overview of
               this exciting area of computational biology.",

                 the increased use of probabilistic models for phylogenetic
                 inference, multiple sequence alignment, and molecular
                 population genetics. Here we present BEAST: a fast, flexible
                 software architecture for Bayesian analysis of molecular
                 sequences related by an evolutionary tree. A large number of
                 popular stochastic models of sequence evolution are provided
                 and tree-based models suitable for both within- and
                 between-species sequence data are implemented. RESULTS: BEAST

  author    = "Grant, Peter R and Grant, R B",
  abstract  = "Charles Darwin's experiences in the Gal�pagos Islands in 1835
               helped to guide his thoughts toward a revolutionary theory: that
               species were not fixed but diversified from their ancestors over
               many generations, and that the driving mechanism of evolutionary
               change was natural selection. In this concise, accessible book,
               Peter and Rosemary Grant explain what we have learned about the
               origin and evolution of new species through the study of the
               finches made famous by that great scientist: Darwin's finches.
               Drawing upon their unique observations of finch evolution over a
               thirty-four-year period, the Grants trace the evolutionary
               history of fourteen different species from a shared ancestor
               three million years ago. They show how repeated cycles of
               speciation involved adaptive change through natural selection on
               beak size and shape, and divergence in songs. They explain other
               factors that drive finch evolution, including geographical
               isolation, which has kept the Gal�pagos relatively free of
               competitors and predators; climate change and an increase in the
               number of islands over the last three million years, which
               enhanced opportunities for speciation; and flexibility in the
               early learning of feeding skills, which helped species to
               exploit new food resources. Throughout, the Grants show how the
               laboratory tools of developmental biology and molecular genetics
               can be combined with observations and experiments on birds in
               the field to gain deeper insights into why the world is so
               biologically rich and diverse. Written by two preeminent
               evolutionary biologists, How and Why Species Multiply helps to
               answer fundamental questions about evolution--in the Gal�pagos

              assume that the points are drawn independently from a common
              distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny,
              they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method
              that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the
              significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of
              these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous

              branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to
              be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these

              diversification in the fossil record. We assume that (1) regions
              become saturated with respect to the number of taxa that can
              coexist; and (2) after that limit is reached, rates of speciation
              and extinction are very similar. Using these minimal constraints,

              upon the fossil record. Of particular interest are the patterns

              For comparison with computer simulations, we present actual

  abstract = "A comparison of the evolutionary rates of cranial morphology in
              mammals with the neutral expectation suggests that stabilizing
              selection is a predominant evolutionary force keeping the
              long-term diversification of lineages well below its potential.
              The rate of morphological divergence of almost all lineages,
              including the great apes, is substantially below the minimum
              neutral expectation. The divergence of the modern races of man is
              slightly above the minimum neutral rate but well below the
              maximum rate. Therefore, there is no need to invoke extraordinary
              mutational mechanisms, such as regulatory gene evolution, to
              explain what has been perceived as rapid morphological evolution
              in mammals. Nor does it appear that behavioral drive needs to be
              invoked to explain rapid morphological evolution in hominoids.
              Outside of man, the long-term rate of phenotypic evolution in the
              great apes is actually lower than that for other mammals. The
              data suggest that, immediately after reproductive isolation, most
              lineages diverge morphologically at approximately the neutral
              rate and that this rate declines over evolutionary time. Such a
              pattern is consistent with a broad class of phenotypic
              evolutionary models that invoke an interaction between the forces
              of random genetic drift, polygenic mutation, and stabilizing
              selection. This pattern also suggests that the apparently rapid
              rates of morphological evolution in modern man relative to other
              mammals and in mammals relative to other vertebrates are
              artifacts of temporal scaling.",

@ARTICLE{Lande1976-ol,
  title    = "Natural Selection and Random Genetic Drift in Phenotypic
              Evolution",
  author   = "Lande, Russell",
  abstract = "The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which
              will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events
              than the classical models of population genetics. This is
              accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic
              parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful
              in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems that
              in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations this
              can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of adaptive
              zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive topography
              for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive topography for gene
              frequencies. This shows that for most phenotypic characters under
              natural selection, the evolution of the average phenotype in a
              population is always toward an adaptive zone of high mean fitness
              (W̄) in the phenotype space. Frequency-dependent selection may
              cause the average phenotype to evolve away from its adaptive
              zone, decreasing the mean fitness of individuals in the
              population; different types of frequency-dependent selection are
              classified as to whether or not they lead to such maladaptive
              evolution. A simple formula for estimating the minimum selective
              mortality per generation necessary to explain observed rates of
              phenotypic evolution is derived (assuming that genetic drift was
              not involved). The minimum mortality rates needed to explain
              observed rates of evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary
              mammals are very small, typically about one selective death per
              million individuals per generation. This leads to consideration
              of the hypothesis that these changes were caused by random
              genetic drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the
              observed evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have
              occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations,
              with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such
              statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the
              adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain.
              Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a
              selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have
              been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that if
              stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is not
              very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones may be
              an important mechanism of evolution in populations of effective
              size in the hundreds or thousands. These results support the
              contention that random genetic drift may play a significant role
              in phenotypic evolution.",

  abstract    = "There are many striking examples of phenotypic convergence in
                 nature, in some cases associated with changes in the same
                 genes. But even mutations in the same gene may have different
                 biochemical properties and thus different evolutionary
                 consequences. Here we dissect the molecular mechanism of
                 convergent evolution in three lizard species with blanched
                 coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico.
                 These White Sands forms have rapidly evolved cryptic
                 coloration in the last few thousand years, presumably to avoid
                 predation. We use cell-based assays to demonstrate that
                 independent mutations in the same gene underlie the convergent
                 blanched phenotypes in two of the three species. Although the
                 same gene contributes to light phenotypes in these White Sands
                 populations, the specific molecular mechanisms leading to
                 reduced melanin production are different. In one case,
                 mutations affect receptor signaling and in the other, the
                 ability of the receptor to integrate into the melanocyte
                 membrane. These functional differences have important
                 ramifications at the organismal level. Derived alleles in the
                 two species show opposite dominance patterns, which in turn
                 affect their visibility to selection and the spatial
                 distribution of alleles across habitats. Our results
                 demonstrate that even when the same gene is responsible for
                 phenotypic convergence, differences in molecular mechanism can
                 have dramatic consequences on trait expression and ultimately
                 the adaptive trajectory.",

              Morphological Character Data",
  author   = "Lewis, Paul O",
  abstract = "Evolutionary biologists have adopted simple likelihood models for
              purposes of estimating ancestral states and evaluating character
              independence on specified phylogenies; however, for purposes of
              estimating phylogenies by using discrete morphological data,
              maximum parsimony remains the only option. This paper explores
              the possibility of using standard, well-behaved Markov models for
              estimating morphological phylogenies (including branch lengths)
              under the likelihood criterion. An important modification of
              standard Markov models involves making the likelihood conditional
              on characters being variable, because constant characters are
              absent in morphological data sets. Without this modification,
              branch lengths are often overestimated, resulting in potentially
              serious biases in tree topology selection. Several new avenues of
              research are opened by an explicitly model-based approach to
              phylogenetic analysis of discrete morphological data, including

  abstract    = "The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based
                 statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency
                 for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous.
                 Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given
                 lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for
                 detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately
                 developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued
                 characters that can be implemented with either
                 phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized
                 least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure
                 allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of
                 similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type
                 I error rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8)
                 for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we
                 derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid
                 comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits
                 and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated
                 branch-length transformations, one based on the
                 Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the
                 other based on a new model in which character evolution can
                 accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur
                 during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood
                 estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as
                 tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g
                 near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical
                 structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data.
                 Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative
                 data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may
                 also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as
                 of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods
                 to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20
                 or more species, 92\% of traits exhibited significant
                 phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral
                 and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively
                 evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or
                 subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic)
                 effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of
                 sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average)
                 showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch
                 lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was
                 less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or
                 measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in
                 estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology).
                 Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35
                 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal
                 than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological
                 traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body
                 size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees
                 with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25\% of traits)
                 and/or ACDC (40\%) transformation parameter differed
                 significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a
                 hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure
                 than the original better fit the data and so could be
                 preferred for comparative analyses.",

                 breeding systems. Transitions from self-incompatibility to
                 self-compatibility are frequent, and they may proceed within a
                 species (``anagenetic'' mode of breeding system change) or in
                 conjunction with speciation events (``cladogenetic'' mode of
                 change). We apply a recently developed phylogenetic model to
                 the nightshade family Solanaceae, quantifying the relative
                 contributions of these two modes of evolution along with the
                 tempo of breeding system change, speciation, and extinction.
                 We find that self-incompatibility, a genetic mechanism that
                 prevents self-fertilization, is lost largely by the
                 cladogenetic mode. Self-compatible species are thus more
                 likely to arise from the isolation of a newly self-compatible
                 population than from species-wide fixation of self-compatible
                 mutants. Shared polymorphism at the locus that governs
                 self-incompatibility shows it to be ancestral and not regained

                 alternative models of phenotypic evolution using a dataset of
                 unprecedented size and temporal span (over 8,000 data points).
                 The data are body-size measurements taken from historical

                 reveal a remarkably consistent pattern in the timing of

                 divergence across timescales ranging from a few generations to
                 10 million generations. The key feature of this model is a

              distinct models with n additive polygenic loci subject to
              mutation and stabilizing selection. Each is reviewed and a new
              analysis and model are presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed
              extensions of a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes
              a continuum of possible allelic effects at each locus. Latter and
              Bulmer analyzed a model with diallelic loci. The published
              analyses of these models lead to qualitatively different
              predictions concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic
              variance on the underlying biological parameters. A new
              asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows that the different
              predictions are not consequences of the number of alleles assumed
              but rather are attributable to assumptions concerning the
              relative magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the phenotypic
              effects of mutation, and the intensity of selection. This

              numerically determined equilibria are presented. In addition,
              empirical estimates of mutation rates and selection intensity are
              reviewed, revealing weaknesses in both the data and its
              connection to the models. Although the mathematical results and
              underlying biological requirements of my analyses are quite
              different from those of Lande , the results do not refute his
              hypothesis that considerable additive genetic variance may be
              maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I argue that
              the validity of this hypothesis can only be determined with
              additional data and mathematics.",

                 have spurred a renaissance of research into the causes and

                 paper, we review these advances. We also highlight the
                 potential of comparative methods to integrate across fields
                 and focus on three examples where such integration might be
                 particularly valuable: quantitative genetics, community
                 ecology, and paleobiology. We argue that PCMs will continue to
                 be a key set of tools in evolutionary biology, shedding new
                 light on how evolutionary processes have shaped patterns of
                 biodiversity through deep time.",
