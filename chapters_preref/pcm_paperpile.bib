  title     = "The fossilized birth--death process for coherent calibration of
               divergence-time estimates",
  author    = "Heath, Tracy A and Huelsenbeck, John P and Stadler, Tanja",
  abstract  = "Time-calibrated species phylogenies are critical for addressing
               a wide range of questions in evolutionary biology, such as those
               that elucidate historical biogeography or uncover patterns of
               coevolution and diversification. Because molecular sequence data
               are not informative on absolute time, external data---most
               commonly, fossil age estimates---are required to calibrate
               estimates of species divergence dates. For Bayesian divergence
               time methods, the common practice for calibration using fossil
               information involves placing arbitrarily chosen parametric
               distributions on internal nodes, often disregarding most of the
               information in the fossil record. We introduce the ``fossilized
               birth--death'' (FBD) process---a model for calibrating
               divergence time estimates in a Bayesian framework, explicitly
               acknowledging that extant species and fossils are part of the
               same macroevolutionary process. Under this model, absolute node
               age estimates are calibrated by a single diversification model
               and arbitrary calibration densities are not necessary. Moreover,
               the FBD model allows for inclusion of all available fossils. We
               performed analyses of simulated data and show that node age
               estimation under the FBD model results in robust and accurate
               estimates of species divergence times with realistic measures of
               statistical uncertainty, overcoming major limitations of
               standard divergence time estimation methods. We used this model
               to estimate the speciation times for a dataset composed of all
               living bears, indicating that the genus Ursus diversified in the
               Late Miocene to Middle Pliocene.",

               to bear in interpreting the fossil record and the book
               introduces the latest techniques, from multivariate
               investigations of biogeography and biostratigraphy to
               engineering analysis of dinosaur skulls, and from homeobox genes
               to cladistics. All the well-known fossil groups are included,
               including microfossils and invertebrates, but an important
               feature is the thorough coverage of plants, vertebrates and
               trace fossils together with discussion of the origins of both
               life and the metazoans. All key related subjects are introduced,
               such as systematics, ecology, evolution and development,
               stratigraphy and their roles in understanding where life came
               from and how it evolved and diversified. Unique features of the

  abstract = "The goal of Phylogenetic Comparative Methods (PCMs) is to study
              the distribution of quantitative traits among related species.
              The observed traits are often seen as the result of a Brownian
              Motion (BM) along the branches of a phylogenetic tree.
              Reticulation events such as hybridization, gene flow or
              horizontal gene transfer, can substantially affect a species'
              traits, but are not modeled by a tree. Phylogenetic networks have
              been designed to represent reticulate evolution. As they become
              available for downstream analyses, new models of trait evolution
              are needed, applicable to networks. One natural extension of the
              BM is to use a weighted average model for the trait of a hybrid,
              at a reticulation point. We develop here an efficient recursive
              algorithm to compute the phylogenetic variance matrix of a trait
              on a network, in only one preorder traversal of the network. We
              then extend the standard PCM tools to this new framework,
              including phylogenetic regression with covariates (or
              phylogenetic ANOVA), ancestral trait reconstruction, and Pagel's
              $\lambda$ test of phylogenetic signal. The trait of a hybrid is
              sometimes outside of the range of its two parents, for instance
              because of hybrid vigor or hybrid depression. These two phenomena
              are rather commonly observed in present-day hybrids.
              Transgressive evolution can be modeled as a shift in the trait
              value following a reticulation point. We develop a general
              framework to handle such shifts, and take advantage of the
              phylogenetic regression view of the problem to design statistical
              tests for ancestral transgressive evolution in the evolutionary
              history of a group of species. We study the power of these tests
              in several scenarios, and show that recent events have indeed the
              strongest impact on the trait distribution of present-day taxa.
              We apply those methods to a dataset of Xiphophorus fishes, to
              confirm and complete previous analysis in this group. All the
              methods developed here are available in the Julia package

  abstract = "It is widely assumed that phenotypic traits can influence rates
              of speciation and extinction, and several statistical approaches
              have been used to test for correlations between character states
              and lineage diversification. Recent work suggests that
              model-based tests of state-dependent speciation and extinction
              are sensitive to model inadequacy and phylogenetic
              pseudoreplication. We describe a simple nonparametric statistical
              test (``FiSSE'') to assess the effects of a binary character on
              lineage diversification rates. The method involves computing a
              test statistic that compares the distributions of branch lengths
              for lineages with and without a character state of interest. The
              value of the test statistic is compared to a null distribution
              generated by simulating character histories on the observed
              phylogeny. Our tests show that FiSSE can reliably infer
              trait-dependent speciation on phylogenies of several hundred
              tips. The method has low power to detect trait-dependent
              extinction but can infer state-dependent differences in
              speciation even when net diversification rates are constant. We
              assemble a range of macroevolutionary scenarios that are
              problematic for likelihood-based methods, and we find that FiSSE
              does not show similarly elevated false positive rates. We suggest
              that nonparametric statistical approaches, such as FiSSE, provide

              {Trait-Dependent} Speciation and Extinction",
  author   = "Beaulieu, Jeremy M and O'Meara, Brian C",
  abstract = "The distribution of diversity can vary considerably from clade to
              clade. Attempts to understand these patterns often employ
              state-dependent speciation and extinction models to determine
              whether the evolution of a particular novel trait has increased
              speciation rates and/or decreased extinction rates. It is still
              unclear, however, whether these models are uncovering important
              drivers of diversification, or whether they are simply pointing
              to more complex patterns involving many unmeasured and
              co-distributed factors. Here we describe an extension to the
              popular state-dependent speciation and extinction models that
              specifically accounts for the presence of unmeasured factors that
              could impact diversification rates estimated for the states of
              any observed trait, addressing at least one major criticism of
              BiSSE (Binary State Speciation and Extinction) methods.
              Specifically, our model, which we refer to as HiSSE (Hidden State
              Speciation and Extinction), assumes that related to each observed
              state in the model are ``hidden'' states that exhibit potentially
              distinct diversification dynamics and transition rates than the
              observed states in isolation. We also demonstrate how our model
              can be used as character-independent diversification models that
              allow for a complex diversification process that is independent
              of the evolution of a character. Under rigorous simulation tests
              and when applied to empirical data, we find that HiSSE performs
              reasonably well, and can at least detect net diversification rate
              differences between observed and hidden states and detect when
              diversification rate differences do not correlate with the
              observed states. We discuss the remaining issues with
              state-dependent speciation and extinction models in general, and
              the important ways in which HiSSE provides a more nuanced
              understanding of trait-dependent diversification.",

              is great interest in identifying ecological, geographic, and
              other factors that affect rates of species proliferation. Recent
              methods for explicitly modeling the relationships among character
              states, speciation rates, and extinction rates on phylogenetic
              trees- BiSSE, QuaSSE, GeoSSE, and related models-have been widely
              used to test hypotheses about character state-dependent
              diversification rates. Here, we document the disconcerting ease
              with which neutral traits are inferred to have statistically
              significant associations with speciation rate. We first
              demonstrate this unfortunate effect for a known model assumption
              violation: shifts in speciation rate associated with a character
              not included in the model. We further show that for many
              empirical phylogenies, characters simulated in the absence of
              state-dependent diversification exhibit an even higher Type I
              error rate, indicating that the method is susceptible to
              additional, unknown model inadequacies. For traits that evolve
              slowly, the root cause appears to be a statistical framework that
              does not require replicated shifts in character state and
              diversification. However, spurious associations between character
              state and speciation rate arise even for traits that lack
              phylogenetic signal, suggesting that phylogenetic
              pseudoreplication alone cannot fully explain the problem. The
              surprising severity of this phenomenon suggests that many
              trait-diversification relationships reported in the literature
              may not be real. More generally, we highlight the need for

               mediated by pollen vectors and the mating system modifier
               experiences a transmission bias through the pollen that leads to
               its selection. Under reproductive assurance, self-pollination is
               autonomous and the mating system modifier is selected as it
               allows seed production when pollinators are scarce. We present

               (structuring) and completion. Here, we use data under

               process rather than an instantaneous event and carry out species
               delimitation inference on these data under the multispecies

               our work raises questions about the practice of genome-based
               species discovery, with cascading consequences in other fields.
               Specifically, all fields that rely on species as units of

              ultrametric tree as the reconstructed tree produced by a given
              model of diversification. Etienne and Rosindell in Syst Biol
              61(2):204-213, (2012) proposed a lineage-based model of
              diversification, called protracted speciation, where species
              remain incipient during a random duration before turning good
              species, and showed that this can explain the slowdown in lineage
              accumulation observed in real phylogenies. However, they were
              unable to provide a general likelihood formula. Here, we present
              a likelihood formula for protracted speciation models, where
              rates at which species turn good or become extinct can depend
              both on their age and on time. Our only restrictive assumption is
              that speciation rate does not depend on species status. Our
              likelihood formula utilizes a new technique, based on the contour

              or incipient species representative of some good extinct species.
              Specifically, we prove that each of these trees is a coalescent
              point process, that is, a planar, ultrametric tree where the

              present. The observed slowdown has been attributed to
              nonconstancy of the speciation and extinction rates due to some
              form of diversity dependence (i.e., species-level density

              lineages. Before looking for the cause of such differences, one
              must establish that the structure of the trees differs

  abstract = "A fundamental question in evolutionary ecology and conservation
              biology is: why do some areas contain greater species diversity
              than others? Island biogeographic theory has identified the roles
              of immigration and extinction in relation to area size and
              proximity to source areas, and the role of speciation is also
              recognized as an important factor. However, one as yet unexplored
              possibility is that species diversity itself might help to
              promote speciation, and indeed the central tenets of island
              biogeographic theory support such a prediction. Here we use data
              for plants and arthropods of the volcanic archipelagos of the
              Canary and Hawaiian Islands to address whether there is a
              positive relationship between species diversity and rate of
              diversification. Our index of diversification for each island is
              the proportion of species that are endemic, and we test our
              prediction that this increases with increasing species number. We
              show that even after controlling for several important physical
              features of islands, diversification is strongly related to
              species number.",

              other large geographic regions remains one of the most
              challenging problems at the intersection of ecology and
              evolution. Here we argue that empirical evidence supports a model
              whereby ecological factors associated with resource availability
              regulate species richness at continental scales. Any large-scale
              predictive model for biological diversity must explain three
              robust patterns in the natural world. First, species richness for
              evolutionary biotas is highly correlated with resource-associated
              surrogate variables, including area, temperature, and
              productivity. Second, species richness across epochal timescales
              is largely stationary in time. Third, the dynamics of diversity
              exhibit clear and predictable responses to mass extinctions, key
              innovations, and other perturbations. Collectively, these
              patterns are readily explained by a model in which species
              richness is regulated by diversity-dependent feedback mechanisms.
              We argue that many purported tests of the ecological limits
              hypothesis, including branching patterns in molecular
              phylogenies, are inherently weak and distract from these three
              core patterns. We have much to learn about the complex hierarchy
              of processes by which local ecological interactions lead to
              diversity dependence at the continental scale, but the empirical
              evidence overwhelmingly suggests that they do.",

              the rate of speciation toward the present. On the basis of
              molecular phylogenies, studies of single clades have frequently
              found evidence for a slowdown in diversification rate and have
              interpreted this as evidence for density dependent speciation.
              However, we demonstrated via simulation that large clades are
              expected to show stronger slowdowns than small clades, even if
              the probability of speciation and extinction remains constant
              through time. This is a consequence of exponential growth:
              clades, which, by chance, diversify at above the average rate
              early in their history, will tend to be large. They will also
              tend to regress back to the average diversification rate later
              on, and therefore show a slowdown. We conducted a meta-analysis
              of the distribution of speciation events through time, focusing
              on sequence-based phylogenies for 45 clades of birds. Thirteen of
              the 23 clades (57\%) that include more than 20 species show
              significant slowdowns. The high frequency of slowdowns observed
              in large clades is even more extreme than expected under a purely
              stochastic constant-rate model, but is consistent with the
              adaptive radiation model. Taken together, our data strongly
              support a model of density-dependent speciation in birds, whereby

  abstract = "In this article we propose a new framework for studying adaptive
              radiations in the context of diversity-dependent diversification.
              Diversity dependence causes diversification to decelerate at the
              end of an adaptive radiation but also plays a key role in the
              initial pulse of diversification. In particular, key innovations
              (which in our definition include novel traits as well as new
              environments) may cause decoupling of the diversity-dependent
              dynamics of the innovative clade from the diversity-dependent
              dynamics of its ancestral clade. We present a likelihood-based
              inference method to test for decoupling of diversity dependence
              using molecular phylogenies. The method, which can handle
              incomplete phylogenies, identifies when the decoupling took place
              and which diversification parameters are affected. We illustrate
              our approach by applying it to the molecular phylogeny of the
              North American clade of the legume tribe Psoraleeae (47 extant
              species, of which 4 are missing). Two diversification rate shifts
              were previously identified for this clade; our analysis shows
              that the first, positive shift can be associated with decoupling
              of two Pediomelum subgenera from the other Psoraleeae lineages,
              while we argue that the second, negative shift can be attributed
              to speciation being protracted. The latter explanation yields
              nonzero extinction rates, in contrast to previous findings. Our
              framework offers a new perspective on macroevolution: new

              Recent studies seeking biological explanations for this pattern

              However, a thorough test of whether such approaches correctly
              infer diversity dependence is lacking. Here, we simulate
              phylogenetic branching under linear negative diversity?dependent
              and diversity?independent models and estimate from the simulated
              phylogenies the maximum?likelihood parameters for three different
              conditionings ? on survival of the birth?death process given the
              crown age, on tree size (N) and on tree size given the crown age.
              We report the accuracy of recovering the simulation parameters
              and the reliability of the model selection based on the ?2
              likelihood ratio test. Parameter estimate accuracy: Conditioning
              on survival given the crown age yields a severe bias of the
              carrying capacity K towards N and an upward bias of the
              speciation rate, particularly in clades where diversity?dependent
              feedbacks are still weak (N « K). Conditioning on N yields an
              overestimate of K and an underestimate of speciation rate,
              particularly when saturation has been reached. Dual conditioning
              yields relatively unbiased parameter estimates on average, but
              the deviation from the true value for any single estimate may be
              large. Model selection reliability: The frequency of incorrectly
              rejecting a diversity?independent model when the simulation was
              diversity?independent (type I error) differs substantially from
              the significance level $\alpha$ used in the likelihood ratio
              test, rendering the likelihood ratio test inappropriate. The
              frequency of correctly rejecting the diversity?independent model
              when the simulation was diversity?dependent (power) is larger
              when the clade is closer to equilibrium and for conditioning on
              crown age. We conclude that conditioning on crown age has the
              best statistical properties overall, but caution that parameter
              estimates may be biased. To assess parameter uncertainty in
              future studies of diversity dependence on real data, we recommend
              parametric bootstrapping, examination of the likelihood surface
              and comparison of estimates across the types of conditioning. To
              assess model selection reliability, we discourage the use of the
              ?2 likelihood ratio test or AIC (which are equivalent in this
              case), but recommend a likelihood ratio test based on parametric
              bootstrap. We illustrate this method for the diversification of

               dramatic diversity loss. However, most analyses of molecular
               phylogenies fail to identify any periods of declining diversity,

               realistic extinction rates and diversity trajectories can be

               derive an analytic expression for the likelihood of a phylogeny

               they suggest that most extant cetaceans arose from four recent

               rates of species diversification through time and among clades

               general framework that can delineate and quantify heterogeneous
               mixtures of dynamic processes within single phylogenies. I
               developed a method that can identify arbitrary numbers of
               time-varying diversification processes on phylogenies without
               specifying their locations in advance. The method uses
               reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo to move between model
               subspaces that vary in the number of distinct diversification
               regimes. The model assumes that changes in evolutionary regimes
               occur across the branches of phylogenetic trees under a compound
               Poisson process and explicitly accounts for rate variation
               through time and among lineages. Using simulated datasets, I
               demonstrate that the method can be used to quantify complex
               mixtures of time-dependent, diversity-dependent, and
               constant-rate diversification processes. I compared the

                   clustering algorithm to identify clades that share common
                   macroevolutionary rate dynamics and to estimate rate
                   parameters. A recent simulation study published in Evolution
                   (2017) by Meyer and Wiens (M\&W) claimed that (i) simple
                   (``MS'') estimators of diversification rates perform much
                   better than BAMM, and (ii) evolutionary rates inferred with

                   suffers from two major conceptual errors that invalidate
                   both primary conclusions. These statistical considerations
                   are not specific to BAMM and apply to all methods for
                   estimating parameters from empirical data where the true
                   grouping structure of the data is unknown. First,
                   M\&W\textbackslash's comparisons between BAMM and MS
                   estimators suffer from false equivalency because the MS
                   estimators are given perfect prior knowledge of the
                   locations of rate shifts on the simulated phylogenies. BAMM
                   is given no such information and must simultaneously
                   estimate the number and location of rate shifts from the
                   data, thus resulting in a massive degrees-of-freedom
                   advantage for the MS estimators.When both methods are given
                   equivalent information, BAMM dramatically outperforms the MS
                   estimators. Second, M\&W\textbackslash's experimental design
                   is unable to assess parameter reliability because their
                   analyses conflate small effect sizes across treatment groups

               on immigration and extinction rates. However, these theories do
               not apply to taxa on land masses, including continents and large
               islands, that generate most of their species in situ. In this
               case, species--area relationships should be driven by higher
               speciation rates in larger areas2,3,4,5,6, a theory that has
               never been quantitatively tested. Here we show that Anolis
               lizards on Caribbean islands meet several expectations of the
               evolutionary theory. Within-island speciation exceeds
               immigration as a source of new species on all islands larger
               than 3,000 km2, whereas speciation is rare on smaller islands.
               Above this threshold island size, the rate of species
               proliferation increases with island area, a process that results
               principally from the positive effects of area on speciation
               rate. Also as expected, the slope of the species--area
               relationship jumps sharply above the threshold. Although Anolis
               lizards have been present on large Caribbean islands for over 30
               million years, there are indications that the current number of

              probability of lineages. Here, we examine the effect of the
              method used to sample lineages. Whereas previous studies have
              assumed random sampling (RS), we consider two extreme cases of
              biased sampling: ``diversified sampling'' (DS), where tips are
              selected to maximize diversity and ``cluster sampling (CS),''
              where sample diversity is minimized. DS appears to be standard
              practice, for example, in analyses of higher taxa, whereas CS may
              occur under special circumstances, for example, in studies of
              geographically defined floras or faunas. Using both simulations
              and analyses of empirical data, we show that inferred rates may
              be heavily biased if the sampling strategy is not modeled
              correctly. In particular, when a diversified sample is treated as
              if it were a random or complete sample, the extinction rate is
              severely underestimated, often close to 0. Such dramatic errors
              may lead to serious consequences, for example, if estimated rates
              are used in assessing the vulnerability of threatened species to
              extinction. Using Bayesian model testing across 18 empirical data
              sets, we show that DS is commonly a better fit to the data than
              complete, random, or cluster sampling (CS). Inappropriate

              phylogenies are sparsely sampled (fewer than 5\% of the described
              species) and taxon sampling is not uniform. Instead, taxa are
              frequently sampled to obtain at least one representative per
              subgroup (e.g. family) and thus to maximize diversity
              (diversified sampling). So far, such complications have been
              ignored, potentially biasing the conclusions that have been
              reached. In this study I derive the likelihood of a birth-death
              process with non-constant (time-dependent) diversification rates
              and diversified taxon sampling. Using simulations I test if the
              true parameters and the sampling method can be recovered when the
              trees are small or medium sized (fewer than 200 taxa). The
              results show that the diversification rates can be inferred and
              the estimates are unbiased for large trees but are biased for
              small trees (fewer than 50 taxa). Furthermore, model selection by
              means of Akaike's Information Criterion favors the true model if
              the true rates differ sufficiently from alternative models (e.g.
              the birth-death model is recovered if the extinction rate is
              large and compared to a pure-birth model). Finally, I applied six
              different diversification rate models--ranging from a
              constant-rate pure birth process to a decreasing speciation rate
              birth-death process but excluding any rate shift models--on three
              large-scale empirical phylogenies (ants, mammals and snakes with
              respectively 149, 164 and 41 sampled species). All three
              phylogenies were constructed by diversified taxon sampling, as
              stated by the authors. However only the snake phylogeny supported
              diversified taxon sampling. Moreover, a parametric bootstrap test
              revealed that none of the tested models provided a good fit to
              the observed data. The model assumptions, such as homogeneous

              observed asymmetry in species richness between sister taxa in
              monophyletic pairs is greater than would be expected under a
              symmetric model have been used widely in studies of rate
              heterogeneity and are particularly useful for groups in which
              paleontological data are problematic. Although one such test
              introduced by Slowinski and Guyer a decade ago has been applied
              to a wide range of clades and evolutionary questions, the
              statistical behavior of the test has not been examined
              extensively, particularly when used with Fisher's procedure for
              combining probabilities to analyze data from multiple independent
              taxon pairs. Here, certain pragmatic difficulties with the
              Slowinski-Guyer test are described, further details of the
              development of a recently introduced likelihood-based relative
              rates test are presented, and standard simulation procedures are
              used to assess the behavior of the two tests in a range of
              situations to determine: (1) the accuracy of the tests' nominal
              Type I error rate; (2) the statistical power of the tests; (3)
              the sensitivity of the tests to inclusion of taxon pairs with few
              species; (4) the behavior of the tests with datasets comprised of
              few taxon pairs; and (5) the sensitivity of the tests to certain
              violations of the null model assumptions. Our results indicate
              that in most biologically plausible scenarios, the
              likelihood-based test has superior statistical properties in
              terms of both Type I error rate and power, and we found no
              scenario in which the Slowinski-Guyer test was distinctly
              superior, although the degree of the discrepancy varies among the
              different scenarios. The Slowinski-Guyer test tends to be much
              more conservative (i.e., very disinclined to reject the null
              hypothesis) in datasets with many small pairs. In most
              situations, the performance of both the likelihood-based test and
              particularly the Slowinski-Guyer test improve when pairs with few
              species are excluded from the computation, although this is
              balanced against a decline in the tests' power and accuracy as
              fewer pairs are included in the dataset. The performance of both
              tests is quite poor when they are applied to datasets in which
              the taxon sizes do not conform to the distribution implied by the
              usual null model. Thus, results of analyses of taxonomic rate
              heterogeneity using the Slowinski-Guyer test can be misleading
              because the test's ability to reject the null hypothesis (equal
              rates) when true is often inaccurate and its ability to reject
              the null hypothesis when the alternative (unequal rates) is true
              is poor, particularly when small taxon pairs are included.
              Although not always perfect, the likelihood-based test provides a
              more accurate and powerful alternative as a relative rates test.",

               macroevolution when data from living and fossil species are
               analysed together in a phylogenetic framework. This merger sets
               up a series of challenges -- for many fossil clades,

               (OU) models can describe an adaptive process of divergence and
               selection. However, inference of the dynamics of adaptive
               landscapes from comparative data is complicated by
               interpretational difficulties, lack of identifiability among

              important endeavor in evolutionary biology. Ecological
              opportunity can liberate a trait as it diversifies through trait
              space, while genetic and selective constraints can limit
              diversification. While many studies have examined the dynamics of
              morphological traits, diverse morphological traits may yield the
              same or similar performance and as performance is often more
              proximately the target of selection, examining only morphology
              may give an incomplete understanding of evolutionary dynamics.
              Here, we ask whether convergent evolution of pad-bearing lizards
              has followed similar evolutionary dynamics, or whether
              independent origins are accompanied by unique constraints and
              selective pressures over macroevolutionary time. We hypothesized

              on determining whether dioecy is more likely to evolve in
              lineages possessing these traits, rather than considering the
              speciation and extinction rates of dioecious lineages with
              certain combinations of traits. To address the association
              between species richness in dioecious lineages as a function of
              the ecological traits, we compared the evolutionary success
              (i.e., relative species richness) of dioecious focal lineages

               systems have been rarely documented at intercontinental scales.
               Here, we evaluate the hypothesis of multiple radiations in the

               known rates of net diversification in plants. Given that

               macroevolutionary inferences regarding the timing and mechanisms
               of cladogenesis, we used Bayesian relaxed clock phylogenetic
               analyses as well as MEDUSA and BiSSE birth-death likelihood
               models of diversification, to evaluate the evolutionary patterns
               of lineage accumulation in Lupinus. We identified 3 significant
               shifts to increased rates of net diversification (r) relative to
               background levels in the genus (r = 0.18-0.48 lineages/myr). The
               primary shift occurred approximately 4.6 Ma (r = 0.48-1.76) in
               the montane regions of western North America, followed by a
               secondary shift approximately 2.7 Ma (r = 0.89-3.33) associated
               with range expansion and diversification of allopatrically
               distributed sister clades in the Mexican highlands and Andes. We
               also recovered evidence for a third independent shift
               approximately 6.5 Ma at the base of a lower elevation eastern
               South American grassland and campo rupestre clade (r =
               0.36-1.33). Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions and BiSSE
               likelihood analyses of correlated diversification indicated that
               increased rates of speciation are strongly associated with the
               derived evolution of perennial life history and invasion of

              processes underlying species diversification and patterns of

              time period to the recent cichlid fish radiations, which are an
              order of magnitude faster than documented bird, arthropod, and
              plant radiations, we focus on the high-altitude flora of the
              Andes, which is the most species-rich of any tropical mountains.
              Because of the recent uplift of the northern Andes, the upland
              environments where much of this rich endemic flora is found have
              been available for colonization only since the late Pliocene or
              Pleistocene, 2-4 million years (Myr) ago. Using DNA sequence data
              we identify a monophyletic group within the genus Lupinus
              representing 81 species endemic to the Andes. The age of this
              clade is estimated to be 1.18-1.76 Myr, implying a
              diversification rate of 2.49-3.72 species per Myr. This exceeds
              previous estimates for plants, providing the most spectacular
              example of explosive plant species diversification documented to
              date. Furthermore, it suggests that the high cichlid
              diversification rates are not unique. Lack of key innovations
              associated with the Andean Lupinus clade suggests that
              diversification was driven by ecological opportunities afforded
              by the emergence of island-like habitats after Andean uplift.
              Data from other genera indicate that lupines are one of a set of
              similarly rapid Andean plant radiations, continental in scale and
              island-like in stimulus, suggesting that the high-elevation
              Andean flora provides a system that rivals other groups,

               be generated within stochastic systems bounded by minimal
               biological constraints. Our system generates an evolutionary
               tree by making random decisions about each lineage in each time
               interval given preset probabilities for branching, extinction
               and persistence (Raup, Gould, Schopf, and Simberloff, 1973).
               Morphology is determined in an independent and equally
               stochastic manner. Using ten hypothetical characters, the
               beginning lineage is given an all zero morphology. At each
               branching point, each character may change by one unit (in a
               positive or negative direction) according to preset
               probabilities for positive change, negative change, and no
               change. Our simulations display most of the ordered features
               generally associated with uni-directional selection:
               morphological coherence of monophyletic groups and incomplete

               correlation among characters; large variation in rates of
               evolution; and specialization of derived forms. We attribute
               much of this order to abstract topological properties of the

               directional causes be sought elsewhere (in functional

               undirected selection may be the rule rather than the exception

              recent origin, i.e., since the beginning of the Miocene, include
              Mediterranean ecosystems such as the California Floristic
              Province, oceanic islands such as the Hawaiian archipelago and
              the Neotropical high elevation ecosystem of the P{\'a}ramos.
              P{\'a}ramos constitute grasslands above the forest tree-line (at
              elevations of c. 2800-4700 m) with high species endemism.
              Organisms that occupy this ecosystem are a likely product of

              the last three to five million years when the Andes reached an
              altitude that was capable of sustaining this type of vegetation.
              We compared net diversification rates of lineages in fast
              evolving biomes using 73 dated molecular phylogenies. Based on

              of species range contraction and expansion that may have resulted
              from the well-documented climatic changes during that period.

              hotspot for both animals and plants. Nevertheless, the ecological
              and evolutionary processes underlying this extraordinary richness
              remain uncertain. Here, we examine the processes that generate
              high richness in the Tropical Andes relative to other regions in
              South America and across different elevations within the Andes,
              using frogs as a model system. We combine distributional data, a
              newly generated time-calibrated phylogeny for 2,318 frog species,
              and phylogenetic comparative methods to test the relative
              importance of diversification rates and colonization times for
              explaining Andean diversity at different scales. At larger scales
              (among regions and families), we find that faster diversification
              rates in Andean clades most likely explain high Andean richness.
              In contrast, at smaller temporal and spatial scales (within
              family-level clades within the Andes), diversification rates
              rarely explain richness patterns. Instead, we show that
              colonization times are important for shaping elevational richness
              patterns within the Andes, with more species found in habitats
              colonized earlier. We suggest that these scale-dependent patterns
              might apply to many other richness gradients. Recognition of this
              scale dependence may help to reconcile conflicting results among
              studies of richness patterns across habitats, regions, and

               planet; hence knowing how many species inhabit Earth is among
               the most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to
               this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the
               world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have
               precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and
               because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven
               highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic
               classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to
               phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent
               and predictable pattern from which the total number of species
               in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was
               validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all
               domains of life, it predicts ∼8.7 million ($\pm$1.3 million SE)
               eukaryotic species globally, of which ∼2.2 million ($\pm$0.18
               million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic
               classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued

              strengthened by also considering the shapes of the phylogenetic
              trees that link extant taxa. The realization that phylogenies
              reflect macroevolutionary processes has led to a growing
              literature of theoretical and comparative studies of tree shape.
              Two aspects of tree shape are particularly important: tree
              balance and the distribution of branch lenghts. We examine and
              evaluate recent developments in and connections between these two
              aspects, and suggest directions for future research. Studies of
              tree shape promise useful and powerful tests of macroevolutionary

              help us detect mass extinctions and adaptive radiations, measure

              associate changes in these rates with ecological or

              researching this history, biologists are often interested in
              attempting to reconstruct phenotypes for the long extinct
              ancestors of living species. Various methods have been developed
              to do this on a phylogeny from the data for extant taxa. In the
              present article, I introduce a new approach for ancestral
              character estimation for discretely valued traits. This approach
              is based on the threshold model from evolutionary quantitative
              genetics. Under the threshold model, the value exhibited by an
              individual or species for a discrete character is determined by
              an underlying, unobserved continuous trait called ``liability.''
              In this new method for ancestral state reconstruction, I use
              Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the
              liabilities of ancestral and tip species, and the relative
              positions of two or more thresholds, from their joint posterior
              probability distribution. Using data simulated under the model, I
              find that the method has very good performance in ancestral
              character estimation. Use of the threshold model for ancestral
              state reconstruction relies on a priori specification of the
              order of the discrete character states along the liability axis.
              I test the use of a Bayesian MCMC information theoretic criterion
              based approach to choose among different hypothesized orderings

               character on diversification rates using likelihood methods
               requires that we be able to calculate the probability that a
               group of extant species would have evolved as observed, given a
               particular model of the character's effect. Here we describe how
               to calculate this probability for a phylogenetic tree and a
               two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution
               (the ``BiSSE'' model, binary-state speciation and extinction).
               The model involves six parameters, specifying two speciation
               rates (rate when the lineage is in state 0; rate when in state
               1), two extinction rates (when in state 0; when in state 1), and
               two rates of character state change (from 0 to 1, and from 1 to
               0). Using these probability calculations, we can do maximum

              character, called liability, that is unobserved and that
              determines the discrete character according to whether the
              liability exceeds a threshold value. A Markov chain Monte Carlo

              of reproductive modes that is unique among terrestrial
              vertebrates. Here, we analyze the evolution of these modes, using

              aquatic breeding nearly as often. Modes with primitive exotrophic
              larvae (feeding outside the egg) frequently give rise to direct
              developers, whereas those with nonfeeding larvae (endotrophic) do

               hormonally-primed Iberian midwife toads, Alytes cisternasii. In
               this species, pairing and fertilization are terrestrial. The
               male cares for the developing embryos on land, carrying them
               twined around his hind limbs until they hatch into tadpoles
               which he releases into water; his investment in the offspring
               then ends. The courtship of A. cisternasii can be divided into a
               pre- and post-ovulatory phase. An encounter is initiated when
               the female approaches the male and is clasped by him in inguinal
               amplexus. Both the male and the female produce vocalizations
               during the period prior to the initiation of amplexus. During
               amplexus, only the female vocalizes, changing her call to one
               that is of lower intensity, longer duration and more regularly
               emitted than before. During inguinal amplexus, the male engages
               in bouts of intense pedalling and gentle rocking behaviour, each
               bout being initiated when the female repositions herself beneath
               him. Rocking and pedalling cease when the female ovulates, at
               which time she exhibits a posture that we call Unkenkrampf.
               Ovulation occurs at this time, and is followed by sperm release
               by the male (seen as a series of lateral compressions of his
               body). After sperm release, the male moves forwards to engage
               the female in cervical amplexus and then manoeuvres his hind
               limbs such that the egg string becomes tangled around his
               ankles. The female may exhibit additional episodes of
               Unkenkrampf during this period, but these are not accompanied by
               further egg release. Episodes of Unkenkrampf (without ovulation)
               also may occur after the male dismounts from the female. Similar
               behaviour patterns to those observed in the laboratory are seen
               in natural populations of A. cisternasii. We compare and

              evolution of these traits are the higher diversity of
              reproductive modes in the tropics and the apparent progression
              from aquatic to terrestrial reproduction, often attributed to
              higher fitness resulting from decreased predation on terrestrial
              eggs and tadpoles. Here, we propose that sexual selection-and not
              only natural selection due to predation-favors terrestrial
              breeding by reducing the loss of fitness due to polyandry. To
              examine this novel selective mechanism, we reconstructed the
              evolution of reproductive diversity in two frog families (Hylidae
              and Leptodactylidae) and tested for concerted evolution of egg
              and tadpole development sites with specific mating behaviors. We
              found that oviposition and tadpole development sites are evolving
              independently, do not show the same diversity and/or
              directionality in terms of terrestriality, and thus may be
              diversifying due to different selective mechanisms. In both
              families, terrestrial egg deposition is correlated with amplexus
              that is hidden from competing males, and in hylids, testes mass
              was significantly larger and more variable in males with exposed
              amplexus that are vulnerable to polyandry. Our results indicate

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The extant squamates (>9400 known species of lizards
               and snakes) are one of the most diverse and conspicuous
               radiations of terrestrial vertebrates, but no studies have
               attempted to reconstruct a phylogeny for the group with
               large-scale taxon sampling. Such an estimate is invaluable for
               comparative evolutionary studies, and to address their
               classification. Here, we present the first large-scale
               phylogenetic estimate for Squamata. RESULTS: The estimated
               phylogeny contains 4161 species, representing all currently
               recognized families and subfamilies. The analysis is based on up
               to 12896 base pairs of sequence data per species (average = 2497
               bp) from 12 genes, including seven nuclear loci (BDNF, c-mos,
               NT3, PDC, R35, RAG-1, and RAG-2), and five mitochondrial genes
               (12S, 16S, cytochrome b, ND2, and ND4). The tree provides
               important confirmation for recent estimates of higher-level
               squamate phylogeny based on molecular data (but with more
               limited taxon sampling), estimates that are very different from
               previous morphology-based hypotheses. The tree also includes
               many relationships that differ from previous molecular estimates
               and many that differ from traditional taxonomy. CONCLUSIONS: We
               present a new large-scale phylogeny of squamate reptiles that
               should be a valuable resource for future comparative studies. We
               also present a revised classification of squamates at the family
               and subfamily level to bring the taxonomy more in line with the
               new phylogenetic hypothesis. This classification includes new,
               resurrected, and modified subfamilies within gymnophthalmid and

               discordant and independent components of diversity. A
               fundamental and largely unanswered question in evolutionary
               biology is why some clades diversify primarily in some of these
               components and not others. Dramatic variation in trunk vertebral
               numbers (14 to >300) among squamate reptiles coincides with
               different body shapes, and snake-like body shapes have evolved
               numerous times. However, whether increased evolutionary rates or
               numbers of vertebrae underlie body shape and taxonomic
               diversification is unknown. Using a supertree of squamates
               including 1375 species, and corresponding vertebral and body
               shape data, we show that increased rates of evolution in
               vertebral numbers have coincided with increased rates and
               disparity in body shape evolution, but not changes in rates of
               taxonomic diversification. We also show that the evolution of
               many vertebrae has not spurred or inhibited body shape or
               taxonomic diversification, suggesting that increased vertebral
               number is not a key innovation. Our findings demonstrate that
               lineage attributes such as the relaxation of constraints on
               vertebral number can facilitate the evolution of novel body
               shapes, but that different factors are responsible for body

               squamates clades, some branches have remained difficult. Among
               the most vexing has been the placement of snakes among lizard

               and examine how this history has affected present-day squamate
               assemblages globally. A dietary shift occurred in the
               evolutionary history of squamates. Iguanian diets contain large
               proportions of ants, other hymenopterans, and beetles, whereas
               these are minor prey in scleroglossan lizards. A preponderance
               of termites, grasshoppers, spiders, and insect larvae in their

               this dietary shift is suggested by dominance of scleroglossans
               in lizard assemblages throughout the world. One scleroglossan
               clade, Autarchoglossa, combined an advanced vomeronasal
               chemosensory system with jaw prehension and increased activity

              central in the study of organic evolution. * Here, I present two
              different graphical methods for visualizing phenotypic evolution
              on the tree. Method 1 is a new approach for plotting the
              posterior density of stochastically mapped character histories
              for a binary (two-state) phenotypic trait on a phylogeny. Method
              2 is a closely related technique that uses ancestral character
              estimation to visualize historical character states for a
              continuous trait along the branches of a tree. * One shortcoming
              of Method 2 is that by mapping the point estimates of ancestral
              states along the branches of the tree, we have effectively
              ignored the uncertainty associated with ancestral character
              estimation of continuous traits. To alleviate this issue, I
              propose a new method for visualizing ancestral state uncertainty
              using a type of projection of the tree into morphospace called a
              `traitgram.' * All of these approaches should prove useful in

              evolution of parental care, mating systems and secondary sexual
              traits. In semi-precocial species, chicks are reliant on the
              parents for feeding, but in precocial species the chicks feed
              themselves. Thus, where the parents are emancipated from feeding
              the young, we predict that there is an increased potential for
              brood desertion, and consequently for the divergence of mating
              systems. In addition, secondary sexual traits are predicted to
              evolve faster in groups with less demanding young. We found that
              precocial development not only allows rapid divergence of
              parental care and mating behaviours, but also promotes the rapid
              diversification of secondary sexual characters, most notably

               the theory in 1972, as an alternative to the idea that

              The ability to measure the statistical power of these methods has
              become crucial to ensure that data quantity keeps pace with
              growing model complexity. Through simulations, we show that
              commonly applied model choice methods based on information
              criteria can have remarkably high error rates; this can be a
              problem because methods to estimate the uncertainty or power are
              not widely known or applied. Furthermore, the power of
              comparative methods can depend significantly on the structure of
              the data. We describe a Monte Carlo-based method which addresses
              both of these challenges, and show how this approach both
              quantifies and substantially reduces errors relative to
              information criteria. The method also produces meaningful

              similarity depends both on the hierarchical phylogenetic
              structure, and on the specific magnitude and types of
              evolutionary changes that accumulate during each generation. In
              this study, we show how models of microevolutionary change can be
              translated into the resulting macroevolutionary patterns. We
              illustrate how the structure of phenotypic covariances expected
              in interspecific measurements can be derived, and how this
              structure depends on the microevolutionary forces guiding
              phenotypic change at each generation. We then explore the
              covariance structure expected from several simple
              microevolutionary models of phenotypic evolution, including
              various combinations of random genetic drift, directional

              well as models of punctuated or burst-like evolution. We find
              that stabilizing selection leads to patterns of exponential
              decrease of between species covariance with phylogenetic
              distance. This is different from the usual linear patterns of
              decrease assumed in most comparative and systematic methods.
              Nevertheless, linear patterns of decrease can result from many

              directional and fluctuating selection as well as modes of

              random sampling drift and mutation in the absence of selection.
              In addition to incorporating the dominance effects of mutant
              alleles, the model yields some insight into the effects of
              linkage and the mating system on the mutational production of
              quantitative-genetic variation. Despite these additional and
              potentially serious complications, it is found that, for small
              populations, the simple predictions obtained by previous
              investigators using additive-genetic models hold reasonably well.
              Even after accounting for dominance and linkage, the equilibrium
              level of genetic variance is unlikely to be much less than 2NVm
              or to be more than 4NVm, where N is the effective population size
              and Vm is the new variance from mutation appearing each
              generation. The rate of increase of the between-line variance per
              generation ultimately equals 2Vm regardless of population size,
              although the time to attain the asymptotic rate is proportional
              to N. Expressions are presented for the rate of approach to the
              equilibrium level of genetic variance and for the expected
              variance of the within-population and between-population genetic
              variances. The relevance of the derived model, which amounts to a

               components: phylogeny and timescale. Phylogeny refers to the
               branching order (relationships) of species or other taxa within
               a group and is crucial for understanding the inheritance of
               traits and for erecting classifications. However, a timescale is
               equally important because it provides a way to compare phylogeny
               directly with the evolution of other organisms and with
               planetary history such as geology, climate, extraterrestrial
               impacts, and other features. The Timetree of Life is the first
               reference book to synthesize the wealth of information relating
               to the temporal component of phylogenetic trees. In the past,
               biologists have relied exclusively upon the fossil record to
               infer an evolutionary timescale. However, recent revolutionary
               advances in molecular biology have made it possible to not only
               estimate the relationships of many groups of organisms, but also
               to estimate their times of divergence with molecular clocks. The
               routine estimation and utilization of these so-called
               'time-trees' could add exciting new dimensions to biology
               including enhanced opportunities to integrate large molecular
               data sets with fossil and biogeographic evidence (and thereby
               foster greater communication between molecular and traditional
               systematists). They could help estimate not only ancestral
               character states but also evolutionary rates in numerous
               categories of organismal phenotype; establish more reliable
               associations between causal historical processes and biological
               outcomes; develop a universally standardized scheme for
               biological classifications; and generally promote novel avenues
               of thought in many arenas of comparative evolutionary biology.
               This authoritative reference work brings together, for the first
               time, experts on all major groups of organisms to assemble a
               timetree of life. The result is a comprehensive resource on
               evolutionary history which will be an indispensable reference
               for scientists, educators, and students in the life sciences,
               earth sciences, and molecular biology. For each major group of

               the evolutionary history of the group, the fossil record, and

               the divergence times are presented for each node in the

              [1, 2]. The evolution of reproductive isolation in sympatry is
              rare, relying on strong selection along steep ecological
              gradients [3-7]. Improved wintering conditions owing to human
              activities promoted the recent establishment of a migratory
              divide in Central European blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) [8, 9].
              Here, we show that differential migratory orientation facilitated
              reproductive isolation of sympatric populations within <30
              generations. The genetic divergence in sympatry exceeds that of
              allopatric blackcaps separated by 800 km and is associated with
              diverse phenotypic divergence. Blackcaps migrating along the
              shorter northwestern route have rounder wings and narrower beaks
              and differ in beak and plumage color from sympatric
              southwest-migrating birds. We suggest that distinct wing and beak
              morphologies are ecomorphological adaptations resulting from
              divergent, multifarious selection regimes during migration. We
              hypothesize that restricted gene flow accelerates the evolution
              of adaptive phenotypic divergence toward the contrasting
              selection regimes. Similar adaptive processes can occur in more

              ancestral state of a character. Our approach thus emphasizes the
              similarity among evolutionary questions asked in comparative

               tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now
               highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization
               has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter
               has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view
               of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts
               related to making formal inferences from more than one model
               (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book,
               but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical
               material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new
               references to the technical literature are given. These changes
               result primarily from our experiences while giving several

              evolutionary radiation of mammals occurred during the early
              Cenozoic, if not that all eutherians originated from a single
              common post-Cretaceous ancestor. Nonetheless, several recent
              molecular analyses claim to show that because several
              interordinal splits occurred during the Cretaceous, a major
              therian radiation was then underway. This claim conflicts with
              statistical evidence from the well-sampled latest Cretaceous and
              Cenozoic North American fossil record. Paleofaunal data confirm
              that there were fewer mammalian species during the latest
              Cretaceous than during any interval of the Cenozoic, and that a
              massive diversification took place during the early Paleocene,
              immediately after a mass extinction. Measurement data show that
              Cretaceous mammals were on average small and occupied a narrow
              range of body sizes; after the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass
              extinction, there was a rapid and permanent shift in the mean.
              The fact that there was an early Cenozoic mammalian radiation is
              entirely compatible with the existence of a few Cretaceous splits

              phylogeny with branch lengths and trait measurements from extant
              taxa. These kinds of approaches ignore historical evidence for
              evolutionary pattern and process contained in the fossil record.
              In this article, we show through simulation that incorporation of
              fossil information dramatically improves our ability to
              distinguish among models of quantitative trait evolution using
              comparative data. We further suggest a novel Bayesian approach
              that allows fossil information to be integrated even when
              explicit phylogenetic hypotheses are lacking for extinct
              representatives of extant clades. By applying this approach to a
              comparative dataset comprising body sizes for caniform

              of evolution with trend toward large body size over alternative
              models such as Brownian motion or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
              Our approach highlights the importance of considering fossil

              increased use of probabilistic models for phylogenetic inference,
              multiple sequence alignment, and molecular population genetics.
              Here we present BEAST: a fast, flexible software architecture for
              Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences related by an
              evolutionary tree. A large number of popular stochastic models of
              sequence evolution are provided and tree-based models suitable
              for both within- and between-species sequence data are
              implemented. RESULTS: BEAST version 1.4.6 consists of 81000 lines
              of Java source code, 779 classes and 81 packages. It provides
              models for DNA and protein sequence evolution, highly parametric

  abstract  = "Charles Darwin's experiences in the Gal�pagos Islands in 1835
               helped to guide his thoughts toward a revolutionary theory: that
               species were not fixed but diversified from their ancestors over
               many generations, and that the driving mechanism of evolutionary
               change was natural selection. In this concise, accessible book,
               Peter and Rosemary Grant explain what we have learned about the
               origin and evolution of new species through the study of the
               finches made famous by that great scientist: Darwin's finches.
               Drawing upon their unique observations of finch evolution over a
               thirty-four-year period, the Grants trace the evolutionary
               history of fourteen different species from a shared ancestor
               three million years ago. They show how repeated cycles of
               speciation involved adaptive change through natural selection on
               beak size and shape, and divergence in songs. They explain other
               factors that drive finch evolution, including geographical
               isolation, which has kept the Gal�pagos relatively free of
               competitors and predators; climate change and an increase in the
               number of islands over the last three million years, which
               enhanced opportunities for speciation; and flexibility in the
               early learning of feeding skills, which helped species to
               exploit new food resources. Throughout, the Grants show how the
               laboratory tools of developmental biology and molecular genetics

               the field to gain deeper insights into why the world is so

              selection is a predominant evolutionary force keeping the
              long-term diversification of lineages well below its potential.
              The rate of morphological divergence of almost all lineages,
              including the great apes, is substantially below the minimum
              neutral expectation. The divergence of the modern races of man is
              slightly above the minimum neutral rate but well below the
              maximum rate. Therefore, there is no need to invoke extraordinary
              mutational mechanisms, such as regulatory gene evolution, to
              explain what has been perceived as rapid morphological evolution
              in mammals. Nor does it appear that behavioral drive needs to be
              invoked to explain rapid morphological evolution in hominoids.
              Outside of man, the long-term rate of phenotypic evolution in the
              great apes is actually lower than that for other mammals. The

              lineages diverge morphologically at approximately the neutral
              rate and that this rate declines over evolutionary time. Such a
              pattern is consistent with a broad class of phenotypic
              evolutionary models that invoke an interaction between the forces
              of random genetic drift, polygenic mutation, and stabilizing
              selection. This pattern also suggests that the apparently rapid
              rates of morphological evolution in modern man relative to other
              mammals and in mammals relative to other vertebrates are
              artifacts of temporal scaling.",

  title    = "Natural Selection and Random Genetic Drift in Phenotypic
              Evolution",
  author   = "Lande, Russell",
  abstract = "The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which
              will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events
              than the classical models of population genetics. This is
              accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic
              parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful
              in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems that
              in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations this
              can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of adaptive
              zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive topography
              for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive topography for gene
              frequencies. This shows that for most phenotypic characters under
              natural selection, the evolution of the average phenotype in a
              population is always toward an adaptive zone of high mean fitness
              (W̄) in the phenotype space. Frequency-dependent selection may
              cause the average phenotype to evolve away from its adaptive
              zone, decreasing the mean fitness of individuals in the
              population; different types of frequency-dependent selection are
              classified as to whether or not they lead to such maladaptive
              evolution. A simple formula for estimating the minimum selective
              mortality per generation necessary to explain observed rates of
              phenotypic evolution is derived (assuming that genetic drift was
              not involved). The minimum mortality rates needed to explain
              observed rates of evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary
              mammals are very small, typically about one selective death per
              million individuals per generation. This leads to consideration
              of the hypothesis that these changes were caused by random
              genetic drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the
              observed evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have
              occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations,
              with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such
              statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the
              adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain.
              Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a
              selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have
              been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that if
              stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is not
              very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones may be
              an important mechanism of evolution in populations of effective
              size in the hundreds or thousands. These results support the
              contention that random genetic drift may play a significant role
              in phenotypic evolution.",

              But even mutations in the same gene may have different
              biochemical properties and thus different evolutionary
              consequences. Here we dissect the molecular mechanism of
              convergent evolution in three lizard species with blanched
              coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico. These
              White Sands forms have rapidly evolved cryptic coloration in the
              last few thousand years, presumably to avoid predation. We use
              cell-based assays to demonstrate that independent mutations in
              the same gene underlie the convergent blanched phenotypes in two
              of the three species. Although the same gene contributes to light
              phenotypes in these White Sands populations, the specific
              molecular mechanisms leading to reduced melanin production are
              different. In one case, mutations affect receptor signaling and
              in the other, the ability of the receptor to integrate into the
              melanocyte membrane. These functional differences have important
              ramifications at the organismal level. Derived alleles in the two
              species show opposite dominance patterns, which in turn affect
              their visibility to selection and the spatial distribution of
              alleles across habitats. Our results demonstrate that even when
              the same gene is responsible for phenotypic convergence,

              purposes of estimating ancestral states and evaluating character
              independence on specified phylogenies; however, for purposes of
              estimating phylogenies by using discrete morphological data,
              maximum parsimony remains the only option. This paper explores
              the possibility of using standard, well-behaved Markov models for

              absent in morphological data sets. Without this modification,

              serious biases in tree topology selection. Several new avenues of

  title    = "Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: behavioral
              traits are more labile",
  author   = "Blomberg, Simon P and Garland, Jr, Theodore and Ives, Anthony R",
  abstract = "The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based
              statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for
              related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether
              this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an
              empirical question, but general tools for detecting and
              quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We
              present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be
              implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or
              generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization
              procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of
              similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I
              error rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for
              simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a
              descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the
              amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we
              provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations,
              one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing
              selection, the other based on a new model in which character
              evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as
              may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum
              likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can
              serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d
              or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical
              structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations
              that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase
              power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable
              for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character
              evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature
              revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\% of traits
              exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test),
              including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be
              relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive)
              and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic)
              effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of
              sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed
              less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and
              a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one),
              which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in
              the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes,
              branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for
              all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits
              exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history,
              or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits
              (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size
              itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25\%
              of traits) and/or ACDC (40\%) transformation parameter differed
              significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a
              hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than
              the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for
              comparative analyses.",

               self-compatibility are frequent, and they may proceed within a
               species (``anagenetic'' mode of breeding system change) or in
               conjunction with speciation events (``cladogenetic'' mode of

               nightshade family Solanaceae, quantifying the relative
               contributions of these two modes of evolution along with the
               tempo of breeding system change, speciation, and extinction. We
               find that self-incompatibility, a genetic mechanism that
               prevents self-fertilization, is lost largely by the cladogenetic
               mode. Self-compatible species are thus more likely to arise from
               the isolation of a newly self-compatible population than from

               our approach to detect differential diversification within a
               Bayesian framework using simulated phylogenies. Differential
               diversification caused by an asymmetry in speciation rates was
               nearly as well detected with only 50\% of extant species
               phylogenetically resolved as with complete phylogenetic
               knowledge. We demonstrate our unresolved clade method with an
               analysis of sexual dimorphism and diversification in shorebirds
               (Charadriiformes). Our methods allow for the direct estimation
               of the effect of a trait on speciation and extinction rates

              methods are BiSSE (binary state speciation and extinction), MuSSE
              (a multistate extension of BiSSE), and QuaSSE (quantitative state
              speciation and extinction). Diversitree also includes methods for
              analysing trait evolution and estimating speciation/extinction
              rates independently. 2. In this note, I describe the features and
              demonstrate use of the package, using a new method, MuSSE
              (multistate speciation and extinction), to examine the joint
              effects of two traits on speciation. 3. Using simulations, I
              found that MuSSE could reliably detect that a binary trait that
              affected speciation rates when simultaneously accounting for
              additional thats that had no effect on speciation rates. 4.

              process because short-term and long-term data have rarely been
              combined into a single analytical framework. Here we test
              alternative models of phenotypic evolution using a dataset of
              unprecedented size and temporal span (over 8,000 data points).
              The data are body-size measurements taken from historical
              studies, the fossil record, and among-species comparative data
              representing mammals, squamates, and birds. By analyzing this
              large dataset, we identify stochastic models that can explain
              evolutionary patterns on both short and long timescales and
              reveal a remarkably consistent pattern in the timing of
              divergence across taxonomic groups. Even though rapid, short-term
              evolution often occurs in intervals shorter than 1 Myr, the
              changes are constrained and do not accumulate over time. Over
              longer intervals (1-360 Myr), this pattern of bounded evolution
              yields to a pattern of increasing divergence with time. The
              best-fitting model to explain this pattern is a model that
              combines rare but substantial bursts of phenotypic change with
              bounded fluctuations on shorter timescales. We suggest that these
              rare bursts reflect permanent changes in adaptive zones, whereas
              the short-term fluctuations represent local variations in niche
              optima due to restricted environmental variation within a stable
              adaptive zone.",

              explain the evolution of phenotypic means using an extensive
              database compiled by Gingerich. Our approach differs from past
              efforts in that we use explicit models of evolutionary process,
              with parameters estimated from contemporary populations, to
              analyze a large sample of divergence data on many different
              timescales. We show that one quantitative genetic model yields a
              good fit to data on phenotypic divergence across timescales
              ranging from a few generations to 10 million generations. The key
              feature of this model is a fitness optimum that moves within
              fixed limits. Conversely, a model of neutral evolution, models
              with a stationary optimum that undergoes Brownian or white noise
              motion, a model with a moving optimum, and a peak shift model all
              fail to account for the data on most or all timescales. We
              discuss our results within the framework of Simpson's concept of
              adaptive landscapes and zones. Our analysis suggests that the
              underlying process causing phenotypic stasis is adaptation to an
              optimum that moves within an adaptive zone with stable

              Lerch's zeta meets the abdominal bristle",
  author   = "Turelli, M",
  abstract = "Most quantitative traits in most populations exhibit heritable
              genetic variation. Lande proposed that high levels of heritable
              variation may be maintained by mutation in the face of
              stabilizing selection. Several analyses have appeared of two
              distinct models with n additive polygenic loci subject to
              mutation and stabilizing selection. Each is reviewed and a new
              analysis and model are presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed
              extensions of a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes
              a continuum of possible allelic effects at each locus. Latter and
              Bulmer analyzed a model with diallelic loci. The published
              analyses of these models lead to qualitatively different
              predictions concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic
              variance on the underlying biological parameters. A new
              asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows that the different
              predictions are not consequences of the number of alleles assumed
              but rather are attributable to assumptions concerning the
              relative magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the phenotypic
              effects of mutation, and the intensity of selection. This
              conclusion is reinforced by analysis of a model with triallelic
              loci. None of the approximate analyses presented are
              mathematically rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display
              the domains of validity for alternative approximations,
              numerically determined equilibria are presented. In addition,
              empirical estimates of mutation rates and selection intensity are
              reviewed, revealing weaknesses in both the data and its
              connection to the models. Although the mathematical results and
              underlying biological requirements of my analyses are quite
              different from those of Lande , the results do not refute his
              hypothesis that considerable additive genetic variance may be
              maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I argue that
              the validity of this hypothesis can only be determined with
              additional data and mathematics.",
