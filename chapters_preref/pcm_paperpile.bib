@ARTICLE{Lande1976-ol,
  title     = "Natural Selection and Random Genetic Drift in Phenotypic
               Evolution",
  author    = "Lande, Russell",
  abstract  = "The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which
               will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events
               than the classical models of population genetics. This is
               accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic
               parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful
               in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems
               that in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations
               this can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of
               adaptive zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive
               topography for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive
               topography for gene frequencies. This shows that for most
               phenotypic characters under natural selection, the evolution of
               the average phenotype in a population is always toward an
               adaptive zone of high mean fitness (W̄) in the phenotype space.
               Frequency-dependent selection may cause the average phenotype to
               evolve away from its adaptive zone, decreasing the mean fitness
               of individuals in the population; different types of
               frequency-dependent selection are classified as to whether or
               not they lead to such maladaptive evolution. A simple formula
               for estimating the minimum selective mortality per generation
               necessary to explain observed rates of phenotypic evolution is
               derived (assuming that genetic drift was not involved). The
               minimum mortality rates needed to explain observed rates of
               evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary mammals are very
               small, typically about one selective death per million
               individuals per generation. This leads to consideration of the
               hypothesis that these changes were caused by random genetic
               drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the observed
               evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have
               occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations,
               with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such
               statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the
               adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain.
               Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a
               selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have
               been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that
               if stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is
               not very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones
               may be an important mechanism of evolution in populations of
               effective size in the hundreds or thousands. These results
               support the contention that random genetic drift may play a
               significant role in phenotypic evolution.",

  abstract    = "There are many striking examples of phenotypic convergence in
                 nature, in some cases associated with changes in the same
                 genes. But even mutations in the same gene may have different
                 biochemical properties and thus different evolutionary
                 consequences. Here we dissect the molecular mechanism of
                 convergent evolution in three lizard species with blanched
                 coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico.
                 These White Sands forms have rapidly evolved cryptic
                 coloration in the last few thousand years, presumably to avoid
                 predation. We use cell-based assays to demonstrate that
                 independent mutations in the same gene underlie the convergent
                 blanched phenotypes in two of the three species. Although the
                 same gene contributes to light phenotypes in these White Sands
                 populations, the specific molecular mechanisms leading to
                 reduced melanin production are different. In one case,
                 mutations affect receptor signaling and in the other, the
                 ability of the receptor to integrate into the melanocyte
                 membrane. These functional differences have important
                 ramifications at the organismal level. Derived alleles in the
                 two species show opposite dominance patterns, which in turn
                 affect their visibility to selection and the spatial
                 distribution of alleles across habitats. Our results
                 demonstrate that even when the same gene is responsible for
                 phenotypic convergence, differences in molecular mechanism can
                 have dramatic consequences on trait expression and ultimately
                 the adaptive trajectory.",
