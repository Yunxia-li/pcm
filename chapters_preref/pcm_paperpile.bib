                 evolutionary radiation of mammals occurred during the early
                 Cenozoic, if not that all eutherians originated from a single
                 common post-Cretaceous ancestor. Nonetheless, several recent
                 molecular analyses claim to show that because several
                 interordinal splits occurred during the Cretaceous, a major
                 therian radiation was then underway. This claim conflicts with
                 statistical evidence from the well-sampled latest Cretaceous
                 and Cenozoic North American fossil record. Paleofaunal data
                 confirm that there were fewer mammalian species during the
                 latest Cretaceous than during any interval of the Cenozoic,
                 and that a massive diversification took place during the early
                 Paleocene, immediately after a mass extinction. Measurement
                 data show that Cretaceous mammals were on average small and
                 occupied a narrow range of body sizes; after the
                 Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction, there was a rapid and
                 permanent shift in the mean. The fact that there was an early
                 Cenozoic mammalian radiation is entirely compatible with the

                 extinction leaves a characteristic signature in the shape of
                 molecular phylogenetic trees, many studies have used data from
                 extant taxa only to infer extinction rates. This is a
                 promising approach for the large number of taxa for which
                 extinction rates cannot be estimated from the fossil record.
                 Here, I explore the consequences of violating a common
                 assumption made by studies of extinction from phylogenetic
                 data. I show that when diversification rates vary among
                 lineages, simple estimators based on the birth-death process
                 are unable to recover true extinction rates. This is
                 problematic for phylogenetic trees with complete taxon
                 sampling as well as for the simpler case of clades with known

                 ignore historical evidence for evolutionary pattern and

              morphological studies reveal profound changes in evolutionary

              Important progress has been made in the development of

                 software architecture for Bayesian analysis of molecular
                 sequences related by an evolutionary tree. A large number of
                 popular stochastic models of sequence evolution are provided
                 and tree-based models suitable for both within- and
                 between-species sequence data are implemented. RESULTS: BEAST

                 classes and 81 packages. It provides models for DNA and
                 protein sequence evolution, highly parametric coalescent
                 analysis, relaxed clock phylogenetics, non-contemporaneous
                 sequence data, statistical alignment and a wide range of

               carried out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression,
               correlation, and contingency table methods, including
               nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn
               independently from a common distribution. When species are taken
               from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent.
               Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause
               overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some
               illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and

               equilibrium models to examine patterns of phyletic
               diversification in the fossil record. We assume that (1) regions
               become saturated with respect to the number of taxa that can
               coexist; and (2) after that limit is reached, rates of

  author    = "Lynch, Michael",
  abstract  = "A comparison of the evolutionary rates of cranial morphology in
               mammals with the neutral expectation suggests that stabilizing
               selection is a predominant evolutionary force keeping the
               long-term diversification of lineages well below its potential.
               The rate of morphological divergence of almost all lineages,
               including the great apes, is substantially below the minimum
               neutral expectation. The divergence of the modern races of man
               is slightly above the minimum neutral rate but well below the
               maximum rate. Therefore, there is no need to invoke
               extraordinary mutational mechanisms, such as regulatory gene
               evolution, to explain what has been perceived as rapid
               morphological evolution in mammals. Nor does it appear that
               behavioral drive needs to be invoked to explain rapid
               morphological evolution in hominoids. Outside of man, the
               long-term rate of phenotypic evolution in the great apes is
               actually lower than that for other mammals. The data suggest
               that, immediately after reproductive isolation, most lineages
               diverge morphologically at approximately the neutral rate and
               that this rate declines over evolutionary time. Such a pattern
               is consistent with a broad class of phenotypic evolutionary
               models that invoke an interaction between the forces of random

@ARTICLE{Lande1976-ol,
  title     = "Natural Selection and Random Genetic Drift in Phenotypic
               Evolution",
  author    = "Lande, Russell",
  abstract  = "The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which
               will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events
               than the classical models of population genetics. This is
               accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic
               parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful
               in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems
               that in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations
               this can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of
               adaptive zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive
               topography for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive
               topography for gene frequencies. This shows that for most
               phenotypic characters under natural selection, the evolution of
               the average phenotype in a population is always toward an
               adaptive zone of high mean fitness (WÌ„) in the phenotype space.
               Frequency-dependent selection may cause the average phenotype to
               evolve away from its adaptive zone, decreasing the mean fitness
               of individuals in the population; different types of
               frequency-dependent selection are classified as to whether or
               not they lead to such maladaptive evolution. A simple formula
               for estimating the minimum selective mortality per generation
               necessary to explain observed rates of phenotypic evolution is
               derived (assuming that genetic drift was not involved). The
               minimum mortality rates needed to explain observed rates of
               evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary mammals are very
               small, typically about one selective death per million
               individuals per generation. This leads to consideration of the
               hypothesis that these changes were caused by random genetic
               drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the observed
               evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have
               occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations,
               with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such
               statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the
               adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain.
               Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a
               selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have
               been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that
               if stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is
               not very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones
               may be an important mechanism of evolution in populations of
               effective size in the hundreds or thousands. These results
               support the contention that random genetic drift may play a
               significant role in phenotypic evolution.",

                 nature, in some cases associated with changes in the same
                 genes. But even mutations in the same gene may have different
                 biochemical properties and thus different evolutionary
                 consequences. Here we dissect the molecular mechanism of
                 convergent evolution in three lizard species with blanched
                 coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico.
                 These White Sands forms have rapidly evolved cryptic
                 coloration in the last few thousand years, presumably to avoid
                 predation. We use cell-based assays to demonstrate that
                 independent mutations in the same gene underlie the convergent
                 blanched phenotypes in two of the three species. Although the
                 same gene contributes to light phenotypes in these White Sands
                 populations, the specific molecular mechanisms leading to
                 reduced melanin production are different. In one case,
                 mutations affect receptor signaling and in the other, the
                 ability of the receptor to integrate into the melanocyte
                 membrane. These functional differences have important
                 ramifications at the organismal level. Derived alleles in the
                 two species show opposite dominance patterns, which in turn
                 affect their visibility to selection and the spatial
                 distribution of alleles across habitats. Our results
                 demonstrate that even when the same gene is responsible for
                 phenotypic convergence, differences in molecular mechanism can
                 have dramatic consequences on trait expression and ultimately
                 the adaptive trajectory.",

                 and process because short-term and long-term data have rarely

                 alternative models of phenotypic evolution using a dataset of
                 unprecedented size and temporal span (over 8,000 data points).
                 The data are body-size measurements taken from historical
                 studies, the fossil record, and among-species comparative data
                 representing mammals, squamates, and birds. By analyzing this
                 large dataset, we identify stochastic models that can explain
                 evolutionary patterns on both short and long timescales and
                 reveal a remarkably consistent pattern in the timing of
                 divergence across taxonomic groups. Even though rapid,
                 short-term evolution often occurs in intervals shorter than 1
                 Myr, the changes are constrained and do not accumulate over
                 time. Over longer intervals (1-360 Myr), this pattern of
                 bounded evolution yields to a pattern of increasing divergence
                 with time. The best-fitting model to explain this pattern is a
                 model that combines rare but substantial bursts of phenotypic
                 change with bounded fluctuations on shorter timescales. We
                 suggest that these rare bursts reflect permanent changes in
                 adaptive zones, whereas the short-term fluctuations represent
                 local variations in niche optima due to restricted
