<h2 id="introduction-plant-diversity-imbalance">Introduction: Plant diversity imbalance</h2>
<p>The diversity of flowering plants (the angiosperms) dwarfs the diversity of their closest evolutionary relatives (Figure 10.1). There are more than 260,000 species of angiosperms (that we know; more are added every day). The clade originated some 130 million years ago, so all of these species have formed since then. One can contrast the diversity of angiosperms with the diversity of other groups that originated at around the same time. For example, gymnosperms, which are as old as angiosperms, include only around 1000 species, and may even represent more than one clade. The diversity of angiosperms also dwarfs the diversity of familiar vertebrate groups of similar age (e.g. squamates, snakes and lizards, which diverged from their sister taxon, the tuatara, some 250 mya or more, include fewer than 8000 species).</p>
<p>The evolutionary rise of angiosperm diversity puzzled Darwin over his career, and the issues surrounding angiosperm diversification are often referred to as “Darwin’s abominable mystery” in the scientific literature (e.g. Davies et al. 2004). The main mystery is the tremendous variation in numbers of species across plant clades (see Figure 10.1). This variation even applies within angiosperms, where some clades are much more diverse than others.</p>
<p>At a global scale, the number of species in a clade can change only via two processes: speciation and extinction. This means that we must look to speciation and extinction rates – and how they vary through time and across clades – to explain phenomena like the extraordinary diversity of Angiosperms. It is to this topic that we turn in the next few chapters. Since Darwin’s time, we have learned an extraordinary amount about the evolutionary processes that led to the diversity of angiosperms that we see today. These data provide an incredible window into the causes and effects of speciation and extinction over macroevolutionary time scales.</p>

<p>Comparative methods can be applied to understand patterns of species richness, both across clades and through time, by estimating speciation and extinction rates. In this chapter, I will introduce birth-death models, by far the most common model for understanding diversification in a comparative framework. I will discuss the mathematics of birth-death models and how these models relate to the shapes of phylogenetic trees. I will describe how to simulate phylogenetic trees under a birth-death model. Finally, I will discuss tree balance and lineage-through-time plots, two common ways to measure the shapes of phylogenetic trees.</p>

<h2 id="the-birth-death-model">The birth-death model</h2>
<p>A birth-death model is a continuous-time Markov process that is typically used to study how the number of individuals in a population change through time. (For macroevolution, these “individuals” are usually species). In a birth-death model, two things can occur: births, where the number of individuals increases by one; and deaths, where the number of individuals decreases by one. We assume that no more than one new individual can form during any one event. In phylogenetic terms, that means that birth-death trees cannot have “hard polytomies.”</p>
<p>In macroevolution, we apply the birth-death model to species, and typically consider a model where each lineage has a constant probability of either giving birth (speciating) or dying (going extinct). We denote the per-lineage birth rate as λ and the per-lineage death rate as μ. For now we consider these rates to be constant, but we will relax that assumption later in the book.</p>
<p>We can understand the behavior of birth-death models if we consider the waiting time between successive speciation and extinction events in the tree. Imagine that we are considering a single lineage that exists at time t0. We can think about the waiting time to the next event, which will either be a speciation event splitting that lineage into two (Figure 10.2A) or an extinction event marking the end of that lineage (Figure 10.2B). Under a birth-death model, both of these events follow a Poisson process, so that the expected waiting time to an event follows an exponential distribution (Figure 10.2C). The expected waiting time to the next speciation event is exponential with parameter λ, and the expected waiting time to the next extinction event exponential with parameter μ. Of course, only one of these can be the next event. The expected waiting time to the next event (of any sort) is exponential with parameter λ + μ, and the probability that that event is speciation is λ / (λ + μ), extinction μ / (λ + μ).</p>

</div>
<p>When we have more than one lineage “alive” in the tree at any time point, then the waiting time to the next event changes, although its distribution is still exponential. In general, if there are N(t) lineages alive at time t, then the waiting time to the next event follows an exponential distribution with parameter N (λ + μ), with the probability that that event is speciation or extinction the same as given above. Using this approach, we can grow phylogenetic trees of any size (Figure 10.2D).</p>
<p>We can derive some important properties of the birth-death process on trees. To do so, it is useful to define two additional parameters, the net diversification rate (r) and the relative extinction rate (ϵ):</p>
<p>(10.1) r=λ-μ ϵ=μ⁄λ</p>
<p>These two parameters simplify some of the equations below, and are also commonly encountered in the literature.</p>
<p>To derive some general properties of the birth-death model, we first consider the process over a small interval of time, Δt. We assume that this interval is so short that it contains at most a single event, either speciation or extinction (the interval might also contain no events at all). The probability of speciation and extinction over the time interval can be expressed as:</p>
<p>(10.2)</p>
<p>We now consider the total number of living species at some time t, and write this as N(t). It is useful to think about the expected value of N(t) under a birth-death model [we consider the full distribution of N(t) below]. The expected value of N(t) after a small time interval Δt is:</p>
<p>(10.3) N(t+Δt)=N(t)+N(t)λΔt-N(t)μΔt</p>
<p>We can convert this to a differential equation by subtracting N(t) from both sides, then dividing by Δt and taking the limit as Δt becomes very small:</p>
<p>(10.4) dN/dt=N(λ-μ)</p>
<p>We can solve this differential equation if we set a boundary condition that N(0)=a; that is, at time 0, we start out with a lineages. We then obtain:</p>
<p>(10.5) N(t)=ae<sup>(λ-μ)t=ae</sup>rt</p>
<p>This deterministic equation gives us the expected value for the number of species through time under a birth-death model. Notice that the number of species grows exponentially through time as long as λ&gt;μ, e.g. r&gt;0, and decays otherwise (Figure 10.3).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/figure10-3.png" alt="Figure 10.3. Expected number of species under a birth-death model with r=λ-μ &gt; 0 and r &lt; 0." />
<p class="caption">Figure 10.3. Expected number of species under a birth-death model with r=λ-μ &gt; 0 and r &lt; 0.</p>
</div>
<p>We are also interested in the stochastic behavior of the model – that is, how much should we expect N(t) to vary from one replicate to the next? We can calculate the full probability distribution for N(t), which we write as p_n (t)=Pr[N(t)=n] for all n ≥ 0, to completely describe the birth-death model’s behavior. To derive this probability distribution, we can start with a set of equations, one for each value of n, which we will denote as p_0 (t) (there are an infinite set of such equations, from p_0to p_∞). We can then write a set of difference equations that describe the different ways that one can reach any state over some small time interval Δt. We again assume that Δt is sufficiently small that at most one event (a birth or a death) can occur. As an example, for n = 0, we can either be at n = 0 at the beginning of the time interval, or be at n = 1 and have the last surviving lineage go extinct. We write this as:</p>
<p>(10.6) p_0 (t+Δt)=p_1 (t)μΔt+p_0 (t)</p>
<p>For any n≥1, we can reach the state of n lineages in three ways: from a birth (from n – 1 to n), a death (from n + 1 to n), or neither (from n to n). This is written as:</p>
<p>(10.7)</p>
<p>p_n (t+Δt)=p_(n-1) (t)(n-1)λΔt+p_(n+1) (t)(n+1)μΔt+p_n (t)(1-n(λ+μ))Δt</p>
<p>We can convert this set of difference equations to differential equations by subtracting p_n (t) from both sides, then dividing by Δt and taking the limit as Δt becomes very small. So, when n = 0, we use 10.6 to obtain:</p>
<p>(10.8) (dp_0)/dt=μp_1</p>
<p>and, from 10.7, for all n≥1:</p>
<p>(10.9) (dp_n)/dt=(n-1)λp_(n-1)+(n+1)μp_(n+1)-n(λ+μ) p_n</p>
<p>We can then solve this set of differentia l equations to obtain the probability distribution of pn(t). Using the same boundary condition, N(0)=a, we have p_0 (t)=1 for n = a and 0 otherwise. Then, we can find the solution to the differential equations 10.8 and 10.9. The derivation of the solution to this set of differential equations is beyond the scope of this book (but see Kot 2001 for a nice explanation of the mathematics). A solution was first obtained by Bailey (1964), but I will use the simpler equivalent form from Foote et al. (1999). For p_0 (t) – that is, the probability that the entire lineage has gone extinct at time t – we have:</p>
<p>(10.10) p_0 (t)=α^a</p>
<p>And for all n≥1:</p>
<p>(10.11)</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>(10.12) α=ϵ(e<sup>rt-1)/(e</sup>rt-ϵ) β=(e<sup>rt-1)/(e</sup>rt-ϵ)</p>
<p>We can first write down the probability that this lineage has gone extinct; this means it has left no descendants at time t:</p>
<p>(10.13) α_1 (t)=Pr[N(t)=0]=ϵ(e<sup>rt-1)/(e</sup>rt-ϵ)</p>
<p>Note that when a = 1 – that is, when we start with a single lineage - equations 10.10 and 10.11 simplify to (Raup 1985):</p>
<p>(10.14) p_0 (t)=α</p>
<p>And for all n≥1:</p>
<p>(10.15) p_n (t)=(1-α)(1-β) β^(i-1)</p>
<p>In all cases the expected number of lineages in the tree is exactly as stated above in equation (10.5), but now we have the full probability distribution of the number of lineages given a, t, λ, and μ. A few plots capture the general shape of this distribution (Figure 10.4).</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Figure 10.4. Probability distributions of N(t) under A. pure birth, B. birth death after a short time, and C. birth-death after a long time.</p>
</div>
<p>There are quite a few comparative methods that use clade species richness and age along with the distribution defined in 10.14 and 10.15 to make inferences about clade diversification rates (see chapter 11).</p>
<h2 id="birth-death-models-and-phylogenetic-trees">Birth-death models and phylogenetic trees</h2>
<p>The above discussion considered the number of lineages under a birth-death model, but not their phylogenetic relationships. However, just by keeping track of the parent-offspring relationships among lineages, we can consider birth-death models that result in phylogenetic trees (e.g. Figure 10.2D).</p>
<p>The main complication in phylogenetic studies of birth-death models is that we get a “censored” view of the process, in that we only observe lineages that survive to the present day. In the above example, if the true phylogenetic tree were the one plotted in 10.5A, we would only have a chance to observe the phylogenetic tree in figure 10.5B – and even then only if we sampled all of the species and reconstructed the tree with perfect accuracy! A partially sampled tree with only extant species can be seen in Figure 10.5C. I will cover the relationship between birth-death models and the branch lengths of phylogenetic trees in much more detail in the next chapter.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/figure10-5.png" alt="Figure 10.5. A. A birth-death tree including all extinct and extant species; B. A birth-death tree including only extant species; and C. A partially sampled birth-death tree including only some extant species." />

</div>
<h2 id="simulating-birth-death-trees">Simulating birth-death trees</h2>
<p>We can use the statistical properties of birth-death models to simulate phylogenetic trees through time. We could begin with a single lineage at time 0. However, phylogenetic tree often start with the first speciation event in the clade, so one can also begin the simulation with two lineages at time 0 (this distinction relates to our earlier discussion of crown versus stem ages; see also chapter 11).</p>
<p>To simulate our tree, we need to draw waiting times between speciation and extinction events, connect new lineages to the tree, and prune lineages when they go extinct. We also need a stopping criterion, which can have to do with a particular number of taxa or a fixed time interval. We will consider the latter, and leave growing trees to a fixed number of taxa as an exercise for the reader. Our simulation algorithm is as follows. I assume that we have a certain number of “living” lineages in our tree (1 or 2 initially), a current time (tc = 0 initially), and a stopping time tstop.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Draw a waiting time ti to the next speciation or extinction event. Waiting times are drawn from an exponential distribution with rate parameter NA * (λ + μ) where NA is the current number of living lineages in the tree.</li>
<li>Check to see if the simulation ends before the next event. That is, if tc + ti &gt; tstop, end the simulation.</li>
<li>Decide whether the next event is a speciation event [with probability λ / (λ + μ)] or an extinction event [with probability μ / (λ + μ)]. This can be done by drawing a uniform random number ui from the interval [0,1] and assigning speciation to the event if ui &lt; λ / (λ + μ) and extinction otherwise.</li>
<li>If (3) is a speciation event, then choose a random living lineage in the tree. Attach a new branch to the tree at this point, and add one new living lineage to the simulation. Return to step 1.</li>
<li>If (3) is an extinction event, choose a random living lineage in the tree. That lineage is now dead. As long as there is still at least one living lineage in the tree, return to (1); otherwise, your whole clade has gone extinct, and you can stop the simulation.</li>
</ol>
<p>This procedure returns a phylogenetic tree that includes both living and dead lineages. One can prune out any extinct taxa to return a birth-death tree of survivors, which is more in line with what we typically study using extant species. It is also worth noting that entire clades can – and often do – go extinct under this protocol before one reaches time tstop.</p>
<p>We can think about phylogenetic predictions of birth-death models in two ways: by considering tree topology, and by considering tree branch lengths. I will consider each of these two aspects of trees below.</p>
<h2 id="tree-topology-tree-shape-and-tree-balance-under-a-birth-death-model">Tree topology, tree shape, and tree balance under a birth-death model</h2>
<p>Tree topology summarizes the patterns of evolutionary relatedness among a group of species independent of the branch lengths of a phylogenetic tree. Two different trees have the same topology if they define the exact same set of clades. This is important because sometimes two trees can look very different and yet still have the same topology (e.g. Figure 10.6 A, B, and C).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/figure10-6.png" alt="Figure 10.6. Several phylogenetic trees showing different ways to plot the same tree shape." />
<p class="caption">Figure 10.6. Several phylogenetic trees showing different ways to plot the same tree shape.</p>
</div>
<p>Tree topology ignores both branch lengths and tree tip labels. For example, the two trees in figure 10.6 A and D have the same tree topology even though they share no tips in common. What they do share is that their nodes have the same patterns in terms of the number of descendants on each “side” of the bifurcation. By contrast, the phylogenetic tree in 10.6 E has a different topology. (Note that what I am calling tree topology is sometimes referred to as “unlabeled” tree topology; e.g. Felsenstein 2004).</p>
<p>Finally, tree balance is a way of expressing differences in the number of descendants between pairs of sister lineages at different points in a phylogenetic tree. For example, consider the phylogenetic tree depicted in figure 10.6D. The deepest split in that tree separates a clade with five species (lizard, snake, turtle, frog, salamander) from a clade with a single species (trout), and so that node in the tree is unbalanced with a (5, 1) pattern. By contrast, the deepest split in 10.6E separates two clades of equal size. In that tree, the deepest node is balanced with a (3, 3) pattern. A number of approaches in macroevolution use balance at nodes and across whole trees to try to capture important evolutionary patterns.</p>
<p>We can start to understand these approaches by considering the balance of a single node n in a phylogenetic tree. There are two clades descended from this node; let’s call them a and b. We assume that the total number of species descended from the node Nn = Na + Nb is constant and that neither Na nor Nb is zero. An important result, first discussed by Farris (1976) for a pure-birth model, is that all possible numerical divisions of Nn into Na + Nb are equally probable. For example, if Nn = 10, then all possible divisions: 1+9, 2+8, 3+7, 4+6, 5+5, 6+4, 7+3, 8+2, and 9+1 are all equally probable, so that each will be predicted to occur with a probability 1/9. Formally</p>
<p>(eq. 10.2) p(N_a│N_n )=1/(N_n-1)</p>
<p>(Note that there is a subtle difference between equation 10.2 above and some equations in the literature, e.g. Slowinsky and Guyer 1993. Ths difference has to do with whether we label the two descendent clades, a and b, or not; if the clades are unlabeled, then there is no difference between 4+6 and 6+4, so that the probability that the largest clade, whichever it might be, has 6 species is twice what is given by my equation). Equation 10.2 applies even if there is extinction, as long as both sister clades have the same speciation and extinction rates (Slowinsky and Guyer 1989). This equation has been used to compare diversification rates between sister clades, either for a single pair or across multiple pairs (see Chapter 11).</p>
<p>Tree balance statistics provide a way of comparing numbers of taxa across all of the nodes in a phylogenetic tree simultaneously. There are a surprisingly large number of tree balance statistics, but all rely on summarizing information about the balance of each node across a whole tree. Colless’ index Ic is one of the simplest – and, perhaps, most commonly used – indices of tree balance. Ic is the sum of the difference in the number of tips subtended on each side of every node in the tree, standardized by the maximum that such a sum can achieve:</p>
<p>(eq. 10.3)</p>
<p>If the tree is perfectly balanced (only possible when N is some power of 2, e.g. 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), then IC = 0 (Figure 10.7C). By contrast, if the tree is completely pectinate, which means that each split in the tree contrasts a clade with 1 species with the rest of the species in the clade, then IC = 1 (Figure 10.7A). Most phylogenetic trees have values of IC between 0 and 1 (Figure 10.7B).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/figure10-7.png" alt="Figure 10.7. A. a pectinate tree; B. a random tree; C. A balanced tree." />
<p class="caption">Figure 10.7. A. a pectinate tree; B. a random tree; C. A balanced tree.</p>
</div>
<p>There are a number of other indices of phylogenetic tree balance (reviewed in Mooers and Heard xxx; and others). All of these indices are used in a similar way: one can then compare the value of the tree index to what one might expect under a particular model of diversification, typically birth-death. In fact, since these indices focus on tree topology and ignore branch lengths, one can actually consider their general behavior under a set of equal-rates Markov (ERM) models. This set includes any model where birth and death rates are equal across all lineages in a phylogenetic tree at a particular time. ERM models include birth-death models as described above, but also encompass models where birth and/or death rates change through time.</p>
<h2 id="lineage-through-time-plots">Lineage-through-time plots</h2>
<p>The other main way to quantify phylogenetic tree shape is by making lineage-through-time plots. These plots have time along the x axis (from the root of the tree to the present day), and the reconstructed number of lineages on the y-axis (Figure 10.8). Since we are usually considering birth-death models, where the number of lineages is expected to grow (or shrink) exponentially through time, then it is typical practice to log-transform the y-axis.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/figure10-8.png" alt="Figure 10.8. Lineage-through-time plot." />
<p class="caption">Figure 10.8. Lineage-through-time plot.</p>
</div>
<p>Lineage-through-time plots are effective ways to visualize patterns of lineage diversification through time. Under a pure-birth model, LTT plots follow a straight line on average (Figure 10.9A). By contrast, extinction should leave a clear signal in LTT plots because the probability of a lineage going extinction depends on how long it has been around; old lineages are much more likely to have been hit by extinction than relatively young lineages. We see this reflected in LTT plots as the “pull of the present” – an upturn in the slope of the LTT plot near the present day (Figure 10.9B). Incomplete sampling – that is, not sampling all of the living species in a clade – can also have a huge impact on the shape of LTT plots (Figure 10.9C). We will discuss LTT plots further in chapter 11, where we will use them to make inferences about patterns of lineage diversification through time.</p>
<div class="figure">

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, I introduced birth-death models and summarized their basic mathematical properties. Birth-death models predict patterns of species diversity over time intervals, and can also be used to model the growth of phylogenetic trees. We can visualize these patterns by measuring tree balance and creating lineage-through-time (LTT) plots.</p>
